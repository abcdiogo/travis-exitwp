		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Rice Cooker Buyers Guide</h2>
Rice. Thinking about it makes me hungry already. I am half Japanese, and as such, I was raised eating rice.

The first time I saw a rice cooker was a gift my grandfather sent from Japan when I was 9 – it was a 5.5-cup Zojirushi model, quite advanced and sophisticated for the time. That thing is a workhorse and it still cooks perfect rice up to this day – longer than my grandparents' marriage, to be honest!
<p class="box"><img class="alignleft wp-image-183 size-thumbnail" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Best-Rice-Cooker-Tiger-JAX-T18U-K-box-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /><strong>My Choice</strong>
The most flexible rice cooker is the Tiger JAX-T18U-K, with a dedicated menu setting for cooking brown rice. It also has a menu setting called tacook - yup, all lowercase letters - which allows you to cook rice and a rice dish for your rice (literal translation of "okazu" or おかず or お数 or お菜 or 御菜 for the other Japanese geeks out there). Japanese usually cook fish-, meat-, vegetable-, or tofu-based side dishes.<img class="alignright wp-image-187 size-thumbnail" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Best-Rice-Cooker-Tiger-JAX-T10U-K-steaming-basket-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />
Tiger's exclusive tacook function works with a tighter-fitting steaming basket. While it reduces the capacity of rice underneath, it allows you to easily cook a full meal for 2-3 people using only one appliance with the touch of one button.
The cost-benefit is good, and this is one appliance that could follow you throughout your life just as faithfully as your dog. Just make sure you get the 10-cup version (model JAX-T18U-K), so you can cook a bigger meal at once and take extra advantage of the tacook meals.

<h2>What is the best rice cooker for sale now?</h2>
[table id=1 /]
<p class="box"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-83" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Rice-Cooker-Zojirushi-NP-NVC10-front-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /><strong>Interesting Alternative</strong>
If money is not an issue, the tastiest rice award goes to the Zojirushi NP-NVC10 – with the downside that this rice cooker cooks rice exclusively, meaning you won't be able to steam vegetables at the same time you cook rice. On the other hand, it will be the best damn rice you have ever eaten in your life!

<h2>How do rice cookers work?</h2>
The technology is incredibly simple. Do you remember how water boils at 100°C? (Make that 212°F if you like things complicated.) And then it stays at that temperature until all the water evaporates?

All rice cookers work under the same basic principle. Once you close the lid and press the button, the rice cooker starts doing its magic and the inner temperature starts rising up to 100°C. Once the water starts boiling, the inner temperature remains at 100°C. When there is no water left, which is right when the rice is done, the temperature starts rising again. Then, a temperature sensor will change the rice cooker setting from cooking mode to heating mode and your rice cooker will beep to signal your rice is cooked to perfection.
<h2>Save time and effort with a steaming basket</h2>
In my (busy) opinion, the most important feature you should have in your rice cooker is a steaming basket. Did you know you can steam veggies in a rice cooker and eat yourself some freshly cooked greens at the same time you are cooking your rice?

For me, eating healthy, balanced food is a priority. Once the rice and veggies are done, I season my steamed veggies with some extra virgin olive oil and salt, or soy sauce and sunflower oil if I am feeling fancy, and that is it.

I also live a busy life and preparing my food quickly is very welcome too. The steaming basket also allows me to use one less pan, which also saves time doing the dishes afterward.

There are two models I recommend that offer steaming baskets: the Tiger JAX-T18U-K and the Oster 004722-000-000. I like the Tiger better than the Oster because the Tiger has a specific menu mode called Synchro-Cooking for cooking foods along the rice.

The Oster is less sophisticated and it can steam vegetables by simply opening the lid while the rice is still cooking, placing the steaming basket, and closing it so the rice cooker can finish its job. This is less optimal because it alters the pot temperature during the cooking process, and rice becomes slightly undercooked or overcooked. This is also a much cheap rice cooker, so you should take that into consideration as well – you get what you pay for.
<h2>By the way, should you lift the lid while cooking rice?</h2>
In short, no. Lifting the rice cooker lid mid-cooking will result in temperature and steam loss, which means lower-quality rice.

Loss of temperature will cause your rice cooker to waste time re-heating the pot, which will result in undercooked rice in the center of the grain, if you do not change cooking time, or overcooked rice on the outside of the grain, if you allow the rice cooker to re-heat to normal temperature and then return to normal cooking mode.

Loss of steam means that less water will enter the rice, so the rice will be dryer than optimal. Adding more water to fix this results in an extra amount of temperature loss, which reinforces the effects of the previous paragraph.
<h2>Retractable cords are very good</h2>
Simply put, you can put away the rice cooker and save counter space in as little as 5 seconds. If your rice cooker is easy to use, chances are you will use it more often. From my analysis, the only rice cooker that has a retractable cord is the Zojirushi.

Let me give you another point of view. I have owned a 3-cup Panasonic rice cooker with a detachable cord when I lived in Japan, between 2008 and 2012. The detachable cord was also practical but there is always a risk of misplacing the cord or having the stupid thing fall behind your refrigerator. (Yeah, don’t ask me how I learned about this possibility. Twice.)
<h2>Get a timer and save time</h2>
If you are leaving home at 7:15 am and you already know you will arrive at 6:20 pm, you can program your rice cooker to have your rice done at 6:40 pm, just enough time to get home, pour yourself some wine, and start preparing your steak.

Should you be late because sometimes life just happens, the rice cooker will keep your rice just as fresh for up to 12 hours due to its auto-switch to the warming function.

Both the Zojirushi NP-NVC-10 and the Tiger JAX-T18U-K have a timer function and memory for two preset times that you can pre-program, for example, for 6:30 am to eat porridge at breakfast and 6:40 pm for rice at dinner.
<h2>The less useful feature</h2>
The award goes to Zojirushi’s Cake menu setting.

Since you are very likely not in Japan, you most probably own an oven or even a toaster oven and will almost definitely use that to bake a proper cake. And even if you were in Japan, you would probably go to a pastry shop and have awesome cake there with a delicious cup of tea.
<h2>Can it cook brown rice?</h2>
Very short answer: yes, all of the best rice cookers can cook brown rice. Some of them even have dedicated menu settings. For details please see the table:

[table id=2 /]
<h2>What is a GABA rice cooker?</h2>
This is a very important difference in favor of the Zojirushi: it has a special brown rice cooking mode called GABA Brown setting.

Some people refer to this as a GABA rice cooker. This menu setting soaks brown rice for 2 hours at 104 °F (40 °C) before start cooking the rice, which boots the levels of an amino acid called Gamma AminoButiric Acid. This GABA is believed to help lower blood pressure, improve kidney function, and relieve stress.

Also, the Zojirushi NP-NVC10 has three pressure levels and utilizes higher pressure (2.8 psig) to allow a higher cooking temperature (221 °F / 105 °C), and this has two effects on brown rice: its consistency becomes soft-yet-chewy, and it also stays softer for a longer period of time – should you choose to reheat rice later on.
<h2>What size should I buy?</h2>
I have owned 3-cup and 5.5-cup rice cookers. In my experience, I prefer the 5.5-cup because it is a capacity that accommodates your daily life throughout your life. Do you remember the Zojirushi rice cooker from 1991? These machines are “buy it for life” items. The nonstick inner coating lasts forever, too.

10-cup and 20-cup rice cookers are useful if you are throwing a party or if you have a small restaurant – the only two places I have ever seen rice cookers that big. And 3-cup rice cookers are only good if you have very limited storage and counter space in your kitchen.

However, my main recommendation is a 10-cup Tiger rice cooker because of its ability to steam foods and prepare rice at the same time. This is a one-dirty-pan solution for a warm, homemade meal, that comes with a free 26-recipe book.
<h2>After all, what is the best rice cooker?</h2>
Considering my research, my current needs, and my experience owning 3 rice cookers previously, my conclusion is that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I16CMXI?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Tiger JAX-T18U-K</a> offers the best cost-benefit. Although you can have much of the same functionality with the cheaper <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001KBY9M8?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Oster 004722-000-000</a>, the balance moves towards the Tiger because:
<ol>
 	<li>the Tiger is bigger and more flexible than the Oster, which allows you to prepare meals for children and/or visits throughout several stages of your life.</li>
 	<li>the Tiger is less messy and just as easy to clean when compared to the Oster, meaning you will be much happier using it because it saves time on meal prep. Since it is practical, It will also be much less likely to be forgotten in a garage shelf gathering dust.</li>
 	<li>the Tiger has several dedicated menu settings, automating the process further and taking off the guesswork. The Oster needs more babysitting to avoid the gooey mess when it starts boiling, and also to add the steaming basket mid-cooking.</li>
</ol>
And since this is the rice cooker I chose to buy with my own money, I also have no issues whatsoever recommending it to you with my Amazon affiliate link. Amazon is reliable, fast, and it has great prices. If anything I wrote helps you make a better purchase, buying through my affiliate link gives me a percentage at no extra cost to you and helps me buy gasoline and travel on weekends. Thanks in any case.]]></content:encoded>

<p style="padding-left: 50px;"><em>The article below was written by my mother. As soon as she heard I was writing a website, she felt compelled to write about her experience with toaster ovens. I hope you find it as useful as I did. <strong>-Diogo</strong></em></p>
I like to eat tasty meals. It is obvious and it may seem simple, and it is: good, few and healthy ingredients, and the little effort possible to make them enjoyable - the visual and smell counts as well.
<h2>Toaster oven: one versatile solution for many meals</h2>
So, having a <strong>perfect warm golden toast at breakfast</strong> improves my good mood at the beginning of my day. And I like to see it jumping out of the toaster, which means for me the forethought of my little pleasure. It is a nice start for a busy day, but thinking to have it flawless is a little bit stressful.

And remembering another great breakfast - the #1 on my personal ranking: you must try the <strong>crunchy, tastiest bacon ever for your pancake</strong> and preparing it in your toaster oven.

And thinking about comfort food, I remember how delightful is when I can have the<strong> finest pizza</strong>: crunchy and golden edges and all the warm, melted, tasty cheese topping.

And at the end of my little list, but not less important, I can’t resist that <strong>juicy piece of chicken</strong>, finished at the grill, so it has a crispy and golden skin.

And how I can have one simple solution for all this kind of food preparation?

By having a toaster oven. Certainly, you have already seen one of these: most of them you can place a slice of bread in the oven and toast it. Some newer, more modern models also offer a bread slot that allows you to put one or two slices of bread in it for a more traditional toaster experience.
<h2>Why should you own a toaster oven?</h2>
A good toaster oven:
<ul>
 	<li>Saves energy - and you save money.</li>
 	<li>Has many different preset cooking programs - and you save time.</li>
 	<li>Is easy to clean - and you save effort.</li>
</ul>
<p class="box"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-167" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Black-and-Decker-TRO420-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />If you only want a basic 4-Slice Toaster Oven, then what you want is the Black and Decker TRO420. The convection function can bake, broil, toast, and keep warm. The swing-down crumb tray under the oven helps you clean the oven easy and in no time. This B&amp;D covers all the basics at a very friendly price.
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01602CV94/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Click here to see Amazon's price.</a></p>

<h2>A good toaster oven saves energy - and you save money</h2>
Smaller than a traditional oven, a toaster oven is faster to reach the temperature you need, so you won’t hesitate to turn it on to warm up only a couple of pretzels or a slice of pizza.

On the other hand, when you will actually cook something, once you pick all the ingredients, you can choose what is fresh at the supermarket - in other words, vegetables and fruits of the season. They are also often cheaper and healthier.

Also, if you are a single person who lives alone, cooking in a traditional oven is more appropriate for a family size meal. And if you cook for your family, it can be advantageous, once you can do a smaller batch of cookies - for example when everyone wants chocolate chip cookies and your little daughter wants peanut butter cookies.

So, whether you only want to warm something for a quick snack or cook a full meal, doing it in a toaster oven is a frugal choice and it will be a convenient countertop appliance.
<h2>A good toaster oven has many different preset cooking programs - and you save time</h2>
The #1 is <strong>toasting</strong>. Besides the obvious goal of toasting a slice of bread, a bagel, or whatever else you want, this feature can help you maintain your dish warm (without further cooking) while you finish preparing whatever other dishes.

Eating warm food feels very good (other than being actually nutritious) and it can be a challenge if you are cooking for your family. Enters the Black and Decker 4-Slice Toaster Oven TRO420 with a specific Keep Warm function.

The #2 important function is <strong>broiling</strong>. Beyond grilling meat or chicken, I suggest you to use it for:
<ul>
 	<li>browning Meringues,</li>
 	<li>finishing a pie,</li>
 	<li>baking potatoes.</li>
</ul>
For everything you need to give a final touch in the oven and "crisp it up", you can use your broiling function.

It can even help your diet because <strong>it drains the excess fat away from what you are about to eat, reducing your calorie intake</strong> and <strong>instantly improving your diet without any food changes</strong> whatsoever.

Important: when you use the broil function, do not leave the toaster oven unattended because the food can quickly burn and maybe catch fire.

The #3 is <strong>convection</strong>. It is a fancy way to say that the manufacturer put a fan inside the oven, so the hot air circulates evenly, which means <strong>your batch of cookies will be evenly cooked</strong>.

(By the way, creating a balanced environment convection ovens <strong>shortens the cooking period up to 30%</strong>, saving you time and obviously money.)

My advice to you, based on my experience: <strong>always, and I mean always, preheat your convection oven</strong>. Remember that golden crunchy piece of bacon that I mentioned previously? Well, it will be more than perfect if you preheat your toaster oven at the maximum temperature for about 5 minutes and then place the bacon strips into the baking pan previously lined with a baking paper. The heat and the time will depend on how thick your bacon is. Try it for yourself and come back here to tell me.

#4 are <strong>infrared ovens</strong>. They work based on an electrical energy that is transformed into a light energy - a spectrum that we can’t see. This infrared light energy is directly transmitted into the food you are cooking.

<strong>Infrared ovens are 30% to 40% more energy efficient than traditional ones</strong>, once they don’t lose the energy heating the air inside the oven and, because of that, you will have a juicer meal.

Not only they are more efficient in terms of energy, <strong>they are also up to 40% faster</strong>. The Panasonic PAN-NB-G110PW Flash Xpress Toaster Oven is a very good example of this energy-saving issue. It also has the Instant Heat function, which eliminates the need for preheating and allows for quick cooking.

Please notice that you can only use metal pans in infrared ovens.
<p class="box"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-166" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Panasonic-infrared-PAN-NB-G110PW-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Speaking of cooking functions: the Panasonic PAN-NB-G110PW Flash Xpress Toaster Oven has 6 preset, illustrated menu buttons for an easy setup. It also automatically calculates the cooking time for bread, frozen foods, and reheating. In other words, this Panasonic infrared oven toaster makes your cooking experience much more simple and enjoyable.

<h2>A good toaster oven is easy to clean - and you save effort</h2>
Good toaster ovens must have drip trays, which helps to preserve your toaster oven clean from crumbs or spills. Some models offer non-stick, removable trays - which help you to take them out for a good cleaning.

Some models, like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01602CV94/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Black and Decker 4-Slice Toaster Oven TRO420</a>, have a swing-down crumb tray that is under the oven, which prevents crumbs from burning inside the oven.
<p class="box"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-165" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/red-silicone-oven-mitts-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />My last piece of advice: wear protection for cooking, especially with a toaster oven. I am used to both pot holders and oven mitts. My recommendation today is this pair of red silicone oven mitts with quilted liner, because they are made of silicone, which is more appropriate once you will be more protected from the heat in comparison with the kilted cotton pot holder, and secondly, because they are 14.7 inches long (some 37 cm if you like to keep things simple), which will also protect your forearm.

I hope you enjoyed our little journey. The first of some I hope.]]></content:encoded>

I know the self-cleaning is expensive, however, I am in a point of my life where I have saved money for other things, and this is one of the very few luxuries where I was willing to pay extra for the convenience.

It offers three attachments for shaving, styling, and bodygroom. The shaving attachment works wet with shaving gel or cream (either in or out of the shower) for improved skin protection, or dry for convenience. The styler attachment has settings for trimming beard and mustache in 5 lengths - from 5'o clock shadow to flawless beard. And the bodygroom attachment is used for trimming body hair in three lengths. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015UICMA2/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Click here to buy it with a 45-day risk-free trial</a>.</p>
Shaving.

How do you feel about it?

For me, you can look at it in two ways. The negative way is to think of a daily grind. You pretend to forget that you need a shave every now and then. You can even buy into the hipster trend, the tight pants, the checkered pants, and pretend to cultivate a beard.
<h2>Begin your days by devoting time to yourself</h2>
I believe in looking in a positive way to shaving. Doesn’t it feel good when you do something for yourself?

For me, shaving is a way where you choose to consciously start your day taking care of yourself and your physical appearance, paying close attention to your own face, and dedicating 5 minutes of your day to yourself. You can also think about the discipline of doing a small activity every day, accumulating the results throughout time, and reap the benefits by becoming a better man.
<h2>About electric shavers</h2>
I have owned both foil shavers and rotary shavers. Consider that any shaver you choose will have a break-in period of two weeks of daily use.

My Braun foil shaver was my first electric razor and it was very practical, but every once in a while it felt miserable because it pulled hair. Trust me: this is not something you want to feel at 6 AM. Plus the foil shaver was very noisy too. Some say that foil technology gives you a closer shave, however, my experience was exactly the opposite.

Currently, I own a Philips rotary shaver. My idea at the time was to upgrade but still get a cheap electric razor, with cheap replacement parts, manufactured by a Western brand – because I was living in Japan at the time. Enters the Philips HQ6070, which I paid around 6,300 yen at the time. After almost nine years of daily usage, I still have it today! The battery still runs great, plus it holds the charge. My only issue with it is the Power button, which started to act on me and it got problematic. To be honest, it happened right after I dropped it around 4 months ago!
<h2>Save time and effort cleaning the razor</h2>
And now came the time to upgrade my shaver. While I could spend some $20 and simply buy new shaver heads, this would not fix the power button issue, and also I was interested in upgrading my electric shaver because I also wanted a new self-cleaning unit.

I like to care about me, but I also want to save time on my chores. I don’t mind thoroughly cleaning my shaver every now and then, however, my free time is very scarce and I want to be doing productive things.
<h2>Simplify your daily routine</h2>
Plus, if it were necessary I could even shave using the car’s rearview mirror because I don’t need to mess with water and/or foam anymore. All I need is to press a button, shave, rub post-shaving balm (optionally), and move on with my day. I also save time and money by shaving with an electric razor – I don’t need to buy foam or razors anymore.
<h2>Save money by not buying razors and foam</h2>
Let’s do the math:
<ul>
 	<li>Shaving Foam = 1 tub/6 months = 2 tubs/year</li>
 	<li>Razors = 1 razor/month</li>
 	<li>Shaver Replacement Heads = 3 heads/year</li>
 	<li>(yearly cost of razors and foam) - (yearly cost of replacement heads) = (yearly savings by using an electric razor)</li>
 	<li>My math for the above = Break Even Point = 5 or 6 years for a decent shaver</li>
 	<li>Getting a good, clean shave = PRICELESS</li>
</ul>
<h2>After All, What Is The Best Electric Razor For Men?</h2>
After doing a lot of research, I decided to buy the Philips Norelco S5370/84 due to its great cost-benefit, self-cleaning ability, reasonable cost for replacement blades, and satisfied consumers who already bought it.

Since this is the shaver that I bought with my hard earned money, I have no problem recommending it to you (and using my affiliate link). Amazon is safe, fast, reliable, and often it is the best price too. They also give you a 60-day period to try out any shaver you want, and you are free to change your mind any time you want.

I organized all my research and wrote a short blurb on each of the models explaining why I consider it to be a great choice. In case anything I wrote helps you to take an informed decision, completing the purchase through my affiliate link gives me a percentage (at no additional cost to you) and helps me buy gasoline and travel on weekends.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, the Summer holidays are gone and you are going to college. And, for that, I chose some very good deals that are essential (or very desirable) in a daily routine off of your parents’ home. Some of them I already have and others I am looking forward to buying myself.

Besides my comments about the item, note that I also mention the rating of Amazon’s customer reviews. Why is that? Because they are all verified purchases, so these real buyers and users who are telling us what they experienced with what they bought, which means for me transparency from real life users.
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Mini Fridge (cooler and warmer)</strong>: If you are searching for a little appliance to cool your drinks cold and keep your pick up delivery food warm, this is a must, saving you time to keep your meal at the right temperature. You can use it in your dorm or plug it into your 12V car adapter. It can be powered by 2A power bank and includes a USB cord for more portability, but it is a cooler, not a fridge, you have to remember that.
<p class="box"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-258 size-large" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Cooluli-Mini-Fridge-Electric-Cooler-and-Warmer-1007x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="566" /><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G7IL3BS/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">
Cooluli Mini Fridge Electric Cooler and Warmer (4 Liter / 6 Can): AC/DC Portable Thermoelectric System w/ Exclusive On the Go USB Power Bank Option</a> (available colors: white, blue, cow, fuchsia, and pink)
It is also a great gift for a new mother, who can leave this mini cooler/warmer in the nursery, and save a visit to the kitchen while calming the newborn late at night. If doing so, just change the beer for milk!</p>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Closer organizers</strong>: You are moving out to a smaller space, so you need something to increase storage space and organize your daily routine: a hanging organizer and shoe organizer are a welcome hand. Nothing to screw or nail on. Just open the box and it is ready to use.
<p class="box"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-260 size-large" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ClosetMaid-97537-Adjustable-Hanging-Organizer-672x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="849" /><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WXIS4NM/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">ClosetMaid 97537 Adjustable Wall &amp; Door Hanging Organizer</a> (left)
These hangers have multiple depths to accomodate different items. You can also adjust the levels to customize your space. No need to drill anything!
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-259 size-large" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ClosetMaid-97536-Adjustable-Hanging-Organizer-SHOE-672x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="849" /><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F2IMFUW/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">ClosetMaid 97536 Adjustable Wall &amp; Door Shoe Organizer</a> (right)
Find everything you are looking for with one glance! Adjust levels as you need. When everything has an easy place to go back to, it stays organized for longer, too.</p>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Laundry hamper</strong>: Having a busy stressful beginning at the college, you will need how to organize your laundry accordingly. When not in use, you can fold it and store it out of the way. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IG6C0D4/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Save time and space with AmazonBasics Foldable Laundry Hamper</a></li>
 	<li><strong>Foldable drying rack</strong>: And talking about laundry, if the weather allows, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H7P1GPO/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">you can save energy and money with this white drying rack</a></li>
 	<li><strong>Air fryer oven tray</strong>: Comfort food remembers you about your mother’s home and you miss it? Better if it is healthier and no messy task. So, for your perfect bacon, crispy chicken with a soft center and crunchy onion rings (for to mention only these 3 that we love to eat at my home), you can do it on the oven, no cooking skills needed with
<p class="box"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-261 size-full" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Air-Fryer-Oven-Tray.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NAFY0W9/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Gotham Steel Nonstick Copper Crisper Tray - AIR FRY IN YOUR OVEN - As Seen on TV by Daniel Green</a>
If you are in a pinch, you could even make homemade burgers here and grill them in a toaster oven. Make a big batch, freeze them, and eat plenty of proteins throughout the week saving time and money.</p>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Robot mop</strong>: Cleaning floors is a hard work and a daily task, plus you need to learn about cleaning techniques (wet mopping, damp sweeping and dry sweeping) that can vary from one type of floor to another, but you can avoid all that with
<p class="box"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-263 size-large" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/iRobot-Braava-jet-240-Mopping-Robot-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="418" /><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019OH9898/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">iRobot Braava jet 240 Mopping Robot</a>
Forget about dusty floors, start saving time with cleaning chores NOW! Works with wood, tile, and stone. It is TINY and navigates in hard to reach spots, too.</p>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Throw blanket</strong>: Depending where you are going to be, the temperatures start to cool down. So, as wise as to eat some chicken broth is to get
<p class="box"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-262 size-large" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Sunbeam-Microplush-Throw-Blanket-1024x653.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="355" /><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008BF2OF0/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Sunbeam Microplush Heated Throw, Walnut, TSM8US-R470-25B00</a>
Who doesn't like to arrive in the bed and find it already warm and comfy? This throw blanket is machine washable and dryer safe, meaning easy maintenance for you.</p>

		<title>What Is The Largest George Foreman Grill With Removable Plates? (Answered)</title>
		<link>http://bestlife52.com/?p=266</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 30 Nov 2017 08:10:52 +0000</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[Marcia]]></dc:creator>
		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://bestlife52.com/?p=266</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="box"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-267 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/George-Foreman-GRP99-250x229.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="229" />The quick answer is the George Foreman GRP99, size 6 servings, with removable plate grill.
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002KINSY/?tag=bestlife52-text-20">You can see it on Amazon</a>, or you can keep on reading my review below and find more details about my experience with a George Foreman grill and more info about this GRP99.</p>
Generally, I don’t answer one question with another one, but what George Foreman grill has to do with my diet? Everything, it is my answer. Years ago I needed to lose some weight and I am very poor doing diets, once I can’t count calories and I need normal portions (5 oz of meat is a very little portion for me) and the standard diets have this kind of philosophy.

<strong>The only way I could do a diet was with a protein diet and cooking with a George Foreman Grill</strong>. Mine worked beautifully.

But now we are talking about George Foreman 6-Serving Removable Plate Grill and Panini Press and I can assure you that is even better than my previous model:
<ul>
 	<li>Save your time, because <strong>the plates can accommodate up to 6 burgers (or 3 large steaks)</strong> since its area measures about 108 square inches.
<ul>
 	<li>According to the owner’s manual, for grilling a 1-inch thick hamburger, 8 oz, you will need 9 to 10 minutes for medium-rare. It is very fast to prepare a meal and, if you need a comparison, it is just as much time as getting a cafe in a coffee shop and waiting in line. And having a guard on each side of the plate will prevent food from slip off, so you will not have to worry about it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Make your meals healthier with George Tough™ Triple non-stick coating which <strong>eliminates the eed for oil and it is very durable.</strong> As a matter of fact, it increases the flavor of the ingredient itself, if you are grilling a T-bone or a slice of zucchini, all you will get is the flavor of the meat or of the veggie itself. Another win is that once you don’t need to add oil to grill, it reduces the mess on the countertop.</li>
 	<li>And even healthier: the patented sloped grill design drains all the unwanted fat to the drip tray for collecting it out.
<ul>
 	<li>And speaking of fat in the kitchen in general, when I used to cook on other electric grills or traditional stove grills, it produced a huge amount of grease splatter. However, <strong>this George Foreman Grill doesn't produce any greasy mess</strong> because its covered clam-shell design that keeps splatter on control.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Don’t deform your steak: the 1 ½ inch floating hinge can accommodate thick pieces of meat (chicken or fish or even pressed paninis).</li>
 	<li>Easy to use: digital timer and adjustable temperature control helps you to handle all aspects of your cooking.</li>
 	<li><strong>Easy to clean</strong>:
<ul>
 	<li>with <strong>removable nonstick grill plates</strong>:
<ul>
 	<li>which are dishwasher-safe making it extremely easy to wash.</li>
 	<li>the con point is that is a little tricky to attach the grill plates, once you have to use the release handles on each side of the plates. But once you learn how to do it, it became very fast and easy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Using the plastic spatula specially designed to firstly scrape off any remaining piece of food.</li>
 	<li>Drip tray is dishwasher safe as well. Welcome to the healthier meal and no trouble to clean.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>3-Year Limited Warranty</strong> which is a pretty long warranty for its market.</li>
</ul>
You can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002KINSY/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">click here to see today's price</a>.

And do you know what is the <strong>best feature of this particular GF grill model</strong>? It is the <strong>removable plates</strong>. However the fact that it is dishwasher safe, I found one review where the writer said that he wait till the plates cooled down and “<em>lay them in the sink, and fill them with water. I don’t fill the sink with water, I just put enough water on the grilles so they are wet. Anytime later after 5 minutes have passed, I can just wipe the plates clean because of the non-stick. I dry them and snap them back onto the grill, and put it away till the next day.</em>” So, I was glad to know that, if I wish so, I don’t need to clean the plates only in the dishwasher. And knowing how hard can be to clean a grill plate full of grease, I can tell you that the removable plates are a great feature of this GF grill model.

I want to add some extra information about the use of indoor grills beside the meat (and I mean about animal protein) because I wanted to improve my intake of vegetables and fruits and doing it with the George Foreman grill make me more enthusiastic about it.

So, I learn how to use my grill to cook zucchini, mushroom, and eggplant or pineapple and instead of boil it (making it without flavor and taking all vitamins and minerals off it) or fry it (could be yummy but increases the calories and grease on what you eat).

And also how to add some flavor in it, I learned some about herbs (rosemary, mint, parsley, cilantro and basil) or garlic, lemon juice and mustard or cinnamon and honey, for instance, instead of the industrial dressing where you always will find gluten, for not to mention tons of colorants or thickeners. It is very simple and fast to prepare grilled veggies or fruits, because all you need to do is clean, wash and slice your preferred vegetable or fruit and grill it.

I took advantage of how speed is to prepare it and improve the presentation: I slice it diagonally and preheated the grill in order to stamp the plates’ lines into the veggie, so I added some visual appeal to my meal as well.

<strong>And, just for you to know: I lost 13,2 pounds using my George Foreman Grill. So, I can tell you that it works.</strong>

It is a 1- Pressure Cooker, 2- Sous Vide, 3- Slow Cooker, 4- Pressure Canner, 5- Rice Cooker, 6- Yogurt Maker, 7- Soup Cooker, 8- Saute, 9- Steamer, 10- Simmer, and 11- Insulation Warmer. Enough of cheap ramen and instant noodles! Eat better and hit your macros with the GeekChef. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0X67O0/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">See Amazon's price here</a> or keep on reading my mother's review below.</p>
Before I answer this question, let me tell you that I am a little gourmand myself. I am repeating myself, you probably already read it before, but it is a fact. And, another important life fact is: what you eat is very important to maintain yourself healthy. I am hungry, rhetorically speaking, to learn about how I can eat better, in a frugal way (not exactly cheaper) and faster if it is possible.

And I learned about sous-vide: it is a cooking technique where you vacuum-seal what you want to cook in a plastic pouch and place it in a water bath or steam appliance and it cooks slowly and in a lower temperature for a longer period (from 1 to 48 hours or more in some cases).

It called my attention that in the sous-vide technique, once you utilize a vacuum-sealed plastic to cook, all vitamins and minerals of what you are cooking are held, so you are capitalizing in all healthier way what you are eating.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-410 size-full" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Best-Multi-Use-Rice-Cooker.png" alt="" width="564" height="200" />

So, even though a little bit contradictory with I stated just before about cooking in a speedway, once sous-vide can take time, when you have a good appliance (like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0X67O0/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">GeekChef Electric Pressure Cooker with Sous Vide Function</a>) that takes care of all the manual work, you don’t need to babysit your stove and you can have it all in a good warm tasty healthy meal when you came back home.

And, for me, the best about sous-vide is that you can do 2 portions of sirloin steak, for instance, and you will save energy and time. Again!

And, another great thing I learn about the GeekChef is that after you cook your sous-vide meat, you can finalize it and make it look good too by sealing it with the sauté function. It is perfect because you will need to clean one (and only one) appliance.

But what makes me more excited about the GeekChef is the multiple function options that you can have: besides the sous-vide feature, you will have the pressure cooker, slow cooker, pressure canner, rice cooker, yogurt maker, soup cooker, sauté, steamer, simmer, and insulation warmer. Wow!

So, taking advantage of another GeekChef feature and thinking about healthy food, I take at least one portion of yogurt daily. I know that there are good bacteria in it, it helps my bowel function, then I learned how to make yogurt at home. The ingredients are just 1 portion of whole yogurt and 1/4 gallon of whole milk. Here is how to make it:
<ul>
 	<li>Heat the milk (if you have a thermometer, near 120° F).</li>
 	<li>Mix it with the whole yogurt (at room temperature).</li>
 	<li>Put it all in a closed container with a lid and keep it in a protected place (like in a cupboard), so the temperature will cool down slowly.</li>
</ul>
Well, it works 85% of the time and the 15% of failure (the yogurt don’t get the right consistency) it is because somebody opens the cupboard door too many times or I didn’t heat the milk at the right temperature, for example. Well, when you make yogurt with the GeekChef you will have 100% of perfect results.

<strong>Buying yogurt at the grocery store is faster, however, it is more expensive too.</strong>

Another cooking function that amazes me is the pressure cooker: it helps me to increase my intake of vegetable protein and iron, with beans and lentils. I loved it in the winter time and my favorite one is “chili con carne” because it is spice as well. A little bit of chili helps you to speed up your metabolism.

So far, GeekChef is the only pressure cooker that has the sous-vide function.
<h2>And the other 5 reasons that make GeekChef a winner are:</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>Save you time: GeekChef can speed up to 70% less time and, therefore, energy. Green bonus!</li>
 	<li>Save you time again: you can delay its start with a timer function. So, it works as you had a private chef at home: select what you want to eat, prepare all the ingredients, close and lock your GeekChef and when you return home, voilà!, everything is ready for a warm meal.</li>
 	<li>Saves you all the guessing by 12 preset programs: imagine that you can program everything by pressing only one button (rice, poultry, bean/chili, soup/porridge, canning, potato, slow cook, sauté, yogurt, sous-vide, steam, and pasta).</li>
 	<li>It is easy to use: instead of setting pressure, which confuses me (if I want to cook a chicken soup, how many PSI I needed to do it properly?) the GeekChef presents Temperature + Time control for friendly use.</li>
 	<li>It is safe to use: there are 11 proven safety mechanisms and includes a 3-ply bottom 304 stainless steel inner pot which is food grade and durable. The body and lid are made of 201 stainless steel for maximum durability.</li>
</ol>
And, for help you to learn better about the GeekChef, I read some Amazon reviews (that I trust because we are talking about verified purchases) that reports that the owner’s manual is too simple and needed to be improved. But I understood that the control panel is what it is: very easy to use and straightforward (the button potatoes is to cook potatoes, for example). What I understood is that “<em>the button name is really only a guide… figure your desire cooking parameters, consult the chart to pick a method that most closely matches</em>” and you will learn by experience.

It is helpful if you are not a pressure cooker beginner, but, even if you feel so, I can tell you that you will enjoy the exercise for to learn how to cook differently. Your health will thank you, I can say it for sure.

		<title>10 Tips To (Finally) Enjoy Exercising</title>
		<link>http://bestlife52.com/?p=328</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 30 Nov -0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Something we can all agree on is that living a healthy lifestyle necessarily involves exercising regularly. Personally, getting started exercising is the hardest part. Whether I didn’t exercise due to actual reasons, or I was just fooling myself with elaborate excuses, the simple fact is that I needed to exercise more than what I did at the time.

But what was it that was holding me back? In my case, it was a mix of laziness, boredom, and lack of motivation. Staying in bed longer, getting annoyed by a repetitive routine, feeling pain and seeing no results were a cycle that repeated itself in my life.

But I changed it all, and here is how I did it:
<h2>1. Seinfeld Method</h2>
Also known as “<a href="https://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret">Don’t Break The Chain</a>”, the Seinfeld method is a simple way to get things done consistently. Get a one-year calendar, hang it somewhere you see often, and get a red marker. After you complete your workout, cross the day with an X. After a few days in a row, you will start forming a chain. As the chain grows longer, you will feel pressured to keep the chain intact.
<h2>2. Get Support</h2>
Get a training partner. Choose someone committed to similar goals as your own – health, building six-pack abs, marathon running, whatever. This works as an insurance against your own lack of motivation. What happens is that you end up feeding off of each other’s motivation, so 1 + 1 here equals more than 2, which leads me to the next item.
<h2>3. Set Realistic Goals</h2>
When you set goals, you gamify your experience. Running a 5k faster, doing more pushups, lifting more, everything can be measured – and improved. Also, when you set goals, you have something to strive for, which is another form of motivation by itself.
<h2>4. Get Out Of Your Comfort Zone</h2>
If you are too tired, you are doing something wrong. If you are not tired, you are also doing something wrong. Balance is key. Feeling somewhat tired means you are pushing your limits just enough to be able to go even further next time.
<h2>5. Let Your Self-Consciousness Go</h2>
So what if you are not in shape and going to a gym full of toned bodies? Guess what, you are there to improve your health. I believe there is also a factor of self-acceptance.

HOWEVER, accepting yourself doesn’t mean you get to accept being a fat slob. It simply means that you acknowledge being a fat slob who wants to get in shape. Pay less attention to others around you and focus on yourself and your workout. You will soon notice that most people else there (who are not futile) also does the same and pays attention to their own workouts.

Also, stop comparing yourself. People are different. They have different bodies, they are in different stages of their lives. Of course everyone would like to have athletic bodies. Just don’t get hung on the fact that someone else gets in shape faster or another is already where you want to be.

The important thing is to focus on your own progress. Each one of us has a different journey. Take care of your own and you will get to enjoy the ride as well.
<h2>6. Short Length</h2>
Anything you do is better than nothing. It is much better to create the daily habit for 15 or 20 minutes, and gradually increase the amount of time as you feel better about it.

If you overwhelm yourself with one-hour workouts and get too tired, or even worse, get injured, then you end up stopping your workouts due to burnout.
<h2>7. Remove Obstacles</h2>
Personally I prefer to exercise at home. I save commute time, which gives me one excuse less. I also do it early in the morning, even before breakfast, so I pay myself first and then go on with the rest of my day. The benefit here is that I avoid that unforeseen circumstances steal my evening gym time.
<h2>8. Distraction Free</h2>
While some people say that music helps time go by, I believe in focusing in my muscles during my workouts. It also helps me watch my posture and leave behind my problems.

Buddhists say to focus on the respiration, I say focus on your movements. It is the best, most beautiful meditation, at it empties the mind from everyday worries, and feeds the soul.
<h2>9. Have Fun</h2>
Life is just too short. Stop taking yourself too seriously. So what if you skip one day or feel too tired. Think about all the other days you had your workout, how much better you slept, how your posture has improved, or whatever else works for you.

Keeping yourself focused in building a healthy habit that will bring you joy and save you lots of money in useless doctor appointments, useless visits to the pharmacy, and the quality of life you are building to your future self.
<h2>10. Find Something You Enjoy Doing</h2>
Cycle to work instead of commuting. Experiment with different exercises, machines, gym classes, find what works for you. Enjoy yourself.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>What Is The Best Food Processor? (Answered)</title>
		<link>http://bestlife52.com/?p=342</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Cooking is a pleasure for me. For those who see it as a chore, it can be more enjoyable when the repetitive kitchen actions are taken care of. In this case, there is “somebody” who do all these annoying tasks - meet the food processor, a special appliance created to slice, dice, chop, grind, mince, puree, knead and shred. Not only that, but also doing all of these tasks as good as a perfect 5-star chef, and even faster than he would do it.

<strong>But do you really need a food processor?</strong> Since this can be an expensive question, it is worth to answer it properly. If I may, let us slice the answer.
<h2>Food Processor Vs. Food Chopper</h2>
So, you are a kitchen newbie and all recipes are a challenge for you. No matter if you are single or married, most of us have very long working days. If you have children and you have to cook large batches every day, please go directly down to <strong>The Best Food Processor Chopper And Dicer</strong>.

Beginners in the kitchen most of the time just prepare something fast, not too elaborate, and can be eaten quickly as well. Your cooking routine is more or less like this:
<ol>
 	<li>My main goal is to come back home and prepare a meal in 30 minutes or so.</li>
 	<li>This meal has to be balanced and nutritious, but without all these complicated steps and sauces. Instead, just a single (or a few) steps – a protein, some carbohydrates and some veggies/salad as well.</li>
 	<li>My goal is going to the supermarket once a week. Sometimes I also do my grocery shopping online too.</li>
 	<li>When I want something fancy, I order a takeout or simply go to a restaurant.</li>
</ol>
Easy ways to accomplish tasty menus compatible with the (lack of) time available are:
<ul>
 	<li>Rice, salad and grilled chicken</li>
 	<li>Pasta al pesto</li>
 	<li>Mushroom risotto</li>
</ul>
If this is your cooking profile, so to speak, I can say to you that in the "battle" between food processor and the food chopper, the chopper is a winner.

For a very small investment in a good chopper, you will get rid of all the hard work like:
<ul>
 	<li>chop fruits, vegetables, and herbs</li>
 	<li>make bread crumbs, and even</li>
 	<li>some chocolate pieces for sprinkling on ice cream.</li>
</ul>
<p class="box"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-343 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Black-and-Decker-1-1-2-Cup-Electric-Food-Chopper-White-HC306C-250x236.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="236" />My suggestion is the Black &amp; Decker 1.5-Cup Electric Food Chopper (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000I0DV6W/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">see price here</a>) which is easy to operate with its one-touch pulse control, plus the parts are dishwasher-safe.
The blade stays sharp and it is safe to use because there is a lock mechanism that prevents touching hazard when the chopper is on. You can easily chop or dice for a salsa; alternating between these modes is simple with the pulse button.</p>
A chopper is also comparatively smaller than a food processor. Think about your kitchen countertop and cabinets and keep that in mind before buying an appliance.
<h2>The Best Food Processor For Chop And Dice</h2>
Another element to consider is that a chopper doesn’t do anything else but chopping. A food processor dices, grinds, minces, kneads, purees, and shreds.

If you are ready for cooking more advanced dishes and put in more effort in your kitchen, the next step in your consideration about a chopper vs food processor is simple. Perhaps a food processor will be a better investment in the following scenarios:
<ul>
 	<li>You cook every day for your family,</li>
 	<li>You have a garden and like to canning, or</li>
 	<li>You like to entertain once on a while.</li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-344 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Breville-BFP800XL-Sous-Chef-Food-Processor-250x250.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" />Then you need a food processor for chopping vegetables. The Breville BFP800XL Sous Chef Food Processor (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005I6ZKCE/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">see today's price</a>) has three great distinctions that makes it the best food processor for chopping and dicing:
<ol>
 	<li>The Breville BFP800XL first slices the vegetable, and then, <strong>hands-free</strong> dices it. It is a WOW factor that saves you time, especially when you have to work large batches of veggies or fruits, for example</li>
 	<li>ExactSlice system, which is an external control that allows you to go from thick to thin and thinner by sliding a lever.</li>
 	<li>Stainless steel finish, which is not distinctive but it still looks very stylish.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Best Food Processor For Pureeing</h2>
So, if you just became a parent, or know someone who did, and their baby is almost 6 months, chances are that the pediatrician has already warned the new parents it is time to start introducing pureed meals for the not-so-newborn.

However, feeding a baby with infant formula gets expensive real quick. Plus, you don't know the actual components, where the ingredients were sourced, how clean the factory is. You just gotta... trust. Trust that a capitalist company will prioritize your family's health, instead of cutting corners to handle a bigger profit distribution by the end of the quarter. Oh, and you gotta trust the company with your family's health, not just your own.

I would rather make larger puree batches each time I cook, freeze them in smaller portions, and then alternate between flavors as the week goes. I bought everything, I know what is in there, I take more control over my family's nutrition. (Of course, I take pleasure in cooking, too, as I said earlier.)
<p class="box"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-351 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Cuisinart-DFP-14BCNY-14-Cup-Food-Processor-Red-146x250.jpg" alt="" width="146" height="250" />If you also want to puree larger batches, the Cuisinart DFP-14NRY 14-Cup Food Processor (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AXM56HG/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">see today's price</a>) is a perfect choice for you. As a matter of fact, you can consider to cook baby food and puree it all in one step. After that, all you have to do is to freeze it in individual portions. If you freeze it, a handy tip is to add less salt during preparation, since frozen food usually gets saltier.</p>

<h2>Best Food Processor For Grating Cheese</h2>
I love pasta and pizza. Whenever I have the time, I also like to make pasta or pizza dough, starting from scratch. Freshly grated cheese is much, much better. Even better, pizza with <em>a lot of cheese</em> - and I grate it too, so it melts faster and better.

Again, it is all about what is your cooking philosophy. I take it seriously, firstly because I like to eat well. Also, as I learned from past experiences, if you eat healthily, you may stay away from the doctors or from medicine for much longer.

Then, returning to the grated cheese issue, I can tell you that a freshly grated cheese on top of homemade fettuccine is a great dish, a powerful meal for who spends energy quickly.

Buying grated cheese means buying a product that has more chance to deteriorate quicker, once it has more air contact and because of that more probability to develop fungi on it. And, being more industrialized, it is more expensive than the cheese you buy by piece.

So, if you think about how folkloric can it be to grate the cheese on the table, remember the checkered tablecloth and the wine and you will have an Italian dinner at home. <em>A mangiare!</em>
<p class="box"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-344 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Breville-BFP800XL-Sous-Chef-Food-Processor-250x250.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" />Though if you need to grate cheese at home in a larger batch, and freeze it, which I do when I find some good offer on a tasty hard cheese go to Breville BFP800XL Sous Chef (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005I6ZKCE/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">see price here</a>), the best food processor for grating cheese./</p>
And recalling Italian meals, we have the worldwide champion: pizza. Other than making the dough in the food processor, you can work in more than one kind of cheese in a food processor with a cheese grater for a pizza party, for example. It is a great way to avoid the industrial amount of yeast that we find in a pre-prepared frozen pizza and enjoy a good homemade one. Did you know that you can develop a yeast intolerance? It is an allergy food trigger that is growing and you can prevent it by making your own pizza at home (dough and grated cheese, all done by your food processor).
<h2>Best Food Processor Under $150</h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-383 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Hamilton-Beach-70740-Food-Processor-200x250.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="250" />If you are certain that you need a food processor, and you are looking for a good cost-benefit ratio, you can have all the most important features of the Hamilton Beach 70740 8-Cup Food Processor.

The first important feature of the Hamilton Beach 70740 is its size. It does nearly every task that one on the big leagues, but in a proportion for a family of 3 (like mine) and to 10 people (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00755KNCS/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">like I read in a review</a>). This is also a good purchase of a serious food processor without spending super pro money.

It helps you to chop, slice, mix, shred, and puree foods at 2 speeds, plus pulse button. The large feed chute reduces the need of pre-cutting the ingredients for processing them. The bowl, lid, and blades (stainless steel slice and shred disc and chopping blade) are all dishwasher safe.
<h2>Food Processor With Stainless Steel Bowl</h2>
<img class="alignleft wp-image-384 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Robot-Coupe-Blixer-250x250.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" />The Robot Coupe Blixer (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0089ONHRM/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">see price here</a>) is a very strong appliance. Its best feature, the Blixer in the name, is a combination of a food processor and a blender that was created for the healthcare industry for to process food for patients with needs of modified diets which shall be given by tube feedings without losing any nutrients. Obviously, if you will use one, it will be for work on purees and patés bringing the smoothest creamy texture ever, in an eye blink.

Its manufacturer is in the market for more than 30 years, but unfortunately, we don’t have any reviews at the moment. I think that is because it has been put in the “Commercial Mixers” as I looked for it, so, the buyers, being entrepreneurs don’t give much value to do reviews. I think, if you are looking for a life lasting food processor, it worth for you to know it at this link
<h2>Best Food Processor For Making Pastry</h2>
As a beginner chef myself, I was searching alternatives to baking to my husband some good pastries, so I am giving it a try.

Baking pastries is a little tricky and my results are going up and down so far, I found out that it has to do with the heat of the dough. When you make it in a food processor, you have to pulse it, this would warm it. Preventing this from happening is simple, I just use frozen butter. So, I cut it into cubes, freeze them and use them in my usual recipe.
<p class="box"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-385 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/KitchenAid-KFP1466CU-14-Cup-Food-Processor-250x203.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="203" />As you have to have work with one food processor with pulse button, take a look at the KitchenAid KFP1466ER. In addition to the pulse button, it has a storage case that helps you to organize all the accessories and save it in the cupboard, which is very useful and it is a product differential. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00LEWUTBS/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Read customer reviews here at Amazon</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you just became a parent for the first time or know someone who did, and their baby is around 6 months, chances are the pediatrician told the new parents it is time to start introducing pureed meals for the baby.

And that is the answer to the question. The most useful gift for a new parent is...
<h2>An Appliance For Cooking Homemade Baby Food!</h2>
You probably already have a blender or an immersion blender at home. You must be thinking, "Which one is the best for making baby food?" From my personal experience, an immersion blender over a blender or a food processor which will bring perfect results for a smooth, single portion baby food.
<h2>First Option: Blender</h2>
Some time ago, I would think about a blender to do some baby food, but a blender is better to work with recipes in which you have to control liquids. After all, when you work with a blender, you don’t have to deal with all the splits. And, because of its design, I tell you that some other things a blender do greatly, like mayonnaise, but, it is difficult to remove it from the blender bottle and, after that, to clean it up.

Another concern about blenders: due to its nature, the high velocity adds a lot of air in the liquid, which increases its the level of oxidation and shortens the meal's lifespan. For example, when you prepare orange juice with carrot (vitamins A and C) in a blender, after a few minutes you will see it darkening and tasting a little bit more bitter due to the oxidation.

I use a blender in fast recipes, like a cake. Yes, you can do it in a blender, instead of a mixer. It will be faster and cleaner because of the better split control, remember? My blender carrot cake is tasty, easy, fast, and healthy with the vitamin A boosted with the carrot.

My blender is my best friend when the recipe is a little bit creamier because it allows me to control better the messy splitting in the kitchen. I use the Ninja Professional Blender (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NGV4506/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">see more details at Amazon</a>). It is a strong, professional power blender option that crushes ice into snow almost instantly. The blades do not spin unless the lid is secured. The parts are BFA free and dishwasher-safe.
<h2>Second Option: Masticating Juicer</h2>
The good thing about a masticating juicer is that parents can also enjoy healthier food and improve their wellness.

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M9GDTPJ/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Aicok Slow Masticating Juicer</a> works as an extractor and a cold press juicer. It features a quiet motor and brings two important accessories: a practical juice jug for your juices and a brush to clean it faster.

This juicer allows you to take more vitamins, minerals and trace minerals and enzymes from the fruits or veggies. Its lower speed prevents oxidation and the cold functioning protects the enzymes, which doesn’t modify the taste of the juice and turn it more healthy.

You can work with leafy greens and fibrous vegetables as celery and ginger and all the fruits and you can even take advantage from the pulp pellets using them in biscuits, soups or cakes.

My advice to you? Clean it right after you use it. This way the little food particles do not dry out, so it is much faster to wash and clean your juicer properly. By the way, reassembly is easy and will not be an obstacle to your juicing.
<h2>Third Option: Immersion Blender</h2>
By far, my immersion blender is the appliance that I use the most in my kitchen. It is my favorite to work with baby food as you can control the final result visually and it doesn't become gummy, but it is tricky to do it in large portions.

I will tell you about my baby food experience: I used to cook all the veggies and a protein in a pressure cooker and I rotated between meat, chicken, and fish for to have distinct protein taste.

And, because of the size of my pressure cooker (3.5L old fashion one, for using on the stove), I cooked soup 3 times a week and I used to divide it into 6 portions. 5 portions I used to freeze and alternate the protein flavor, so it wouldn’t be annoying to eat it.

And when I fed my baby, I had to blender it. At that time, I did it in one conventional blender, but today, I shall use an immersion blender. Cleaning is easier and the result is perfect. Very smooth for the first months, when the baby learns to eat salty soups.

An immersion blender is also great to do emulsion, like mayonnaise.

I make mayonnaise directly in a mason jar, so I can save me cleaning up my big blender and I can put the mayonnaise straight in the fridge to preserve it properly.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Pro tip: I also add some olive oil on my mayonnaise. It tastes much better and adds some monounsaturated fats in my family's diet, which reduces the risk of coronary heart disease. Sometimes I also add a pinch of cayenne pepper too, which helps preserve the mayonnaise and decrease the coronary disease risk as well. Healthy hearts for all!</p>
The best immersion blender is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NQE8B0/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach 59765 Hand Blender</a>. It has a blending wand, two speeds, and a whisk &amp; chopping bowl. So you are paying merely for an immersion blender, but you already are getting some other good and needed kitchen solutions. Almost as complete as a food processor!

An alternative for you, if you need to perform lots of pureeing work also, is the  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00C7186XI/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach 72860 Stack and Press 3-Cup Glass Bowl Chopper</a>, because of its good reviews on it. I can imagine it doing the job well done also because you don’t have to worry about splits, but only in little batches. It is friendly cleaning as per the bowl, lid and chopping blade are dishwasher safe. Great usability as per only one press lid for turn it on.

If you are interested in a simpler immersion blender version, check the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017AJ12OQ/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Ovente Hand Immersion Blender Set</a>. It has two blending speeds that allow you to get the meal’s texture you are looking for. The stainless steel body is ergonomically designed, giving you comfortable control and a good grip. The attachments are dishwasher-safe and BPA-Free: stainless steel mixing stick and egg whisk, besides its 24 oz heavy duty Tritan beaker with cup measurements.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-351 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Cuisinart-DFP-14BCNY-14-Cup-Food-Processor-Red-146x250.jpg" alt="" width="146" height="250" />But, if you want to puree in larger batches, the Cuisinart DFP-14NRY (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AXM56HG/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">see Amazon's price</a>) is my choice. As a matter of fact, you can consider to cook your baby food and pureeing it - all in one step. After that, you can freeze the baby food in individual portions. Your option has to be made considering on how you can deal with the baby food, once if you freeze it already in puree form, it will become saltier (as all the freezing meals), but it is a good option as well.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Hand Cheese Grater</title>
		<link>http://bestlife52.com/?p=352</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-391 size-large" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Zyliss-Classic-Cheese-Grater-1024x769.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="418" />

If you only need small amounts of grated cheese, it is better for you to look for a hand cheese grater. I have spent many years grating cheese with a box grater, and that was always frustrating. After trying the Zyliss Classic Cheese Grater (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MGLOW8C/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">see Amazon's price</a>), I have no idea why I haven't bought one like these before.

The Zyliss has a classic design, preferred by top restaurants worldwide. It is ergonomic for both left or right-handed users. Its drum grater is made of stainless steel and provides easy cleanup because it is dishwasher-safe and completely removable. It is especially good with hard cheese, like parmesan or Grana Padano.

The Zyliss Classic Cheese Grater is also better than a regular box grater because is safer for your fingers. On the other hand (pardon the pun!), you have to pay attention and press the cheese down with your thumb while you turn the crank to grate the cheese, otherwise, the drum turns without grating the cheese.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-392 size-large" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Zyliss-Classic-Cheese-Grater-In-Use-769x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="742" />

The Zyliss makes for a great (and very useful) housewarming gift for a foodie friend. It won't break the bank and each time your friend has a family gathering at home, he will certainly remember you fondly. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MGLOW8C/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Get it here at Amazon</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Managing The New Season&#039;s Allergies (Updated Fall 2017)</title>
		<link>http://bestlife52.com/?p=356</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, the summer and the holidays are gone and now the days keep getting shorter and shorter. Well, it is fall (or autumn). Time for to be back to school, think about Thanksgiving and to be prepared to fight against allergies.
<h2>Autumn Allergies Triggers</h2>
According to the main medical researchers, fall allergies have some triggers, as follows:
<ul>
 	<li>Ragweed that starts to release pollen in August, which can last until October, is the biggest fall allergy trigger. Up to 75% of people allergic to spring plants, as well as to bananas, melon, and zucchini, are responsive to ragweed. And, be aware that ragweed pollen can travel for hundreds of miles on the wind.</li>
 	<li>Mold that can grow on piles of damp leaves as well as in your basement or bathroom.</li>
 	<li>And dust mites that went dormant on the end of the summer, and can get stirred into the air when you first turn on your heat in the fall.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Warning</strong>: keep in mind that kids are more exposure to mold and dust mites, as well as chalk dust, or even food that triggers allergies, when they are going back to school. So, it is wise to notify the school nurse about eventual children’s allergies.

The leading allergy’s symptoms are:
<ul>
 	<li>watery eyes,</li>
 	<li>sneezing,</li>
 	<li>itchy eyes,</li>
 	<li>runny noses, and</li>
 	<li>dark circles under the eyes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How To Manage Symptoms</h2>
While you can simply take medicines when fall arrives, <strong>you can also actively prevent all the symptoms and boost your immunity</strong>. Here is a list of some healthy solutions:
<h3>Yogurt</h3>
The healthy bacteria found in yogurt make your gut and intestinal tract stronger to fight against disease-causing germs. Look for “live and active cultures” yogurt like Greek yogurt. I take my daily serving plain and sweeten it with healthy fruits or homemade jelly.
<p class="box"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-279 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/GeekChef-Multi-Functional-Electric-Pressure-Cooker-250x250.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" />You can make your own yogurt at home with the GeekChef 11-in-1 Multi-Functional Electric Pressure Cooker. And besides yogurt, you will have a pressure cooker, slow cooker, pressure canner, rice cooker, sous-vide, soup cooker, sautée, steamer, simmer, and insulation warmer. You can save time and money cooking at home, eat better, and save on kitchen counter space with this multi-functional electric pressure cooker. You can learn more about the GeekChef <a href="http://bestlife52.com/kitchen/best-multi-use-rice-cooker/">here</a>.</p>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-362 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Euro-Cuisine-Yogurt-Maker-250x209.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="209" />If you would rather have an exclusive appliance for making yogurt, then your best choice is the <strong>Euro Cuisine YM80 Yogurt Maker</strong> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EX16RY/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">see lowest price here</a>). It comes with seven glass jars and they are dishwasher safe and allow you to make up to seven different yogurt flavors per batch. You can also use a bigger pyrex container if you want to make larger batches each time.
<p class="box"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-363 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Greek-Yogurt-Starter-Culture-250x250.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" />Whether you use a yogurt maker or not, make sure you eat plenty of good bacteria in your homemade yogurt by using the Greek Yogurt Starter Culture (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002HPHR0W/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">see lowest price</a>) which is a blend of bacteria that enriches your yogurt and gives you easier digestion. Handle it properly and your Greek Yogurt Starter Culture can be reused indefinitely.</p>

<h3>Chicken soup</h3>
Comfort food is a must for me and when the temperatures drop in the fall, chicken soup is my best option.

As I learned, besides being a tasty choice during these cold days, when the chicken is cooked, it releases <em>cysteine acid</em>. This acid chemically resembles the bronchitis drug <em>acetylcysteine</em>, which may explain at least one scientific study, made by the University of Nebraska, that found that eating chicken soup blocks the migration of inflammatory white cells in the bronchial tubes.

Another important help is the great amount of vitamin B-6 which is founded in chicken meat, as well as poultry and turkey. 3 ounces of chicken meat contains 40 to 50% of your daily recommended amount of B-6. Vitamin B-6 is responsible, among other tasks, for the formation of new healthy red blood cells.

<strong>Important to mention</strong>: the soup’s salty broth make the mucus thinner, as cough medicines do, without all the side effects. If you add garlic and onion, you certainly increase the immune-boosting power of your chicken soup. And I cook it with some carrots too, finely grated, to add some carotene - vitamin A precursor.

Another relevant fact is that chicken broth made by boiling chicken bones contains chondroitin and gelatin plus other serviceable nutrients to increase immunity and the gut healing.
<p class="box"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-365 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Crock-Pot-6-Quart-Programmable-Cook-Carry-Slow-Cooker-with-Digital-Timer-250x194.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="194" />Chicken soup can be a warm choice, but it take a good amount of time to prepare some. The GeekChef I mentioned above allows you to save time in the kitchen. Another good option is the Crock-Pot 6-Quart Programmable Cook &amp; Carry Slow Cooker with Digital Timer. You can program what will be your cooking period (between 30 minutes to 20 hours). Once the cycle is complete, it will progress automatically to the Warm setting, so, when you run back home, your meal is waiting for you at the right temperature. And it is easy to clean as well. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004P2NG0K/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">See more reviews and details here</a>.</p>

<h3>Tea</h3>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Black tea</strong>: a Harvard study found that people who daily drank 5 cups of black tea for 2 weeks had 10 times more interferon, a virus-fighting substance, than others who drank a hot drink placebo. L-theanine is an abundant amino acid responsible for this immune boost through the production of germ-fighting compounds in white cells of your blood, T-cells type, which are present in the decaf versions too.</li>
 	<li><strong>Green tea</strong>: it has a lot of epigallocatechin gallate, which is a powerful antioxidant and has shown to increases the immune function. Green tea is also a good source of L-theanine.</li>
</ul>
<p class="box"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-369 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Ovente-KG83-Electric-Kettle-250x250.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" />And in order to be ready for making a cup of tea any time, I suggest you to have an electric kettle handy, such as the Ovente KG83 Electric Kettle. It has a concealed heating element and its capacity is 1.5 L (6.3 cups). It boils water 85% more efficient than if you boil it on the stove. It has a LED indicator that will turn on as it begins to boil and automatically shut off after boiling. The automatic shut-off button works as a dry protection function, as well if there is no water in the carafe. It comes with an easy-to-clean filter that suppresses limescale deposits. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DEPGY7G/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Find today's lowest price here</a>.</p>
<strong>Always prefer organic tea</strong>. Yes, organic can be more expensive than commercial products, but we are talking avoiding medicines and doctors, so it is better to invest in good products that will work for you, instead of bringing more man-made chemicals into your body.

My suggestion is the Stash Organic Tea Six-Flavor Assortment. You will receive 6 boxes, each with one different flavor and 18 tea bags, for a total of 108 tea bags. I like the Stash Organic Tea because it blends more than one flavor per bag, which means that you will drink more than one group of vitamins and elements that will further boost your immunity. And, of course among these 6 flavors, we will find black and green tea. Besides all these benefits, it is Kof-K Kosher certified. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005Q8BLA4/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Read verified reviews here.</a>
<h3>Zinc</h3>
Zinc is a primordial mineral for the development of white blood cells and one of the most common nutritional shortfalls on adults in America.

So, the good running of your immunity system is directly linked to the zinc supply to your body, once even a little zinc deficiency can rise the infection risk.

As beef is the main source of zinc, those who have cut it also have increased their allergy exposure.

3 ounces of beef can provide about 30% of the Daily Value (DV) for zinc, which is probably sufficient for stopping this mineral deficiency. If you are not a beef person, you can ingest zinc from yogurt, pork, poultry or oyster.

Besides the countless ways to provide your beef intake, you can also choose to do supplement zinc. This is especially good for men of all ages. My suggestion is the Garden of Life Zinc Vitamin Supplement with Vitamin C (60 Capsules). This supplement contains 200% of the zinc's DV (30 mg RAW zinc) and 100% of raw vitamin C DV. Since zinc can be a little aggressive for your stomach, Garden of Life Zinc Vitamin contain a great protection for your digestive system by adding a raw probiotic and enzyme blend. Besides all these benefits, it is vegan, gluten free, dairy free and non-GMO. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0098U0QC0/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Click here to read customer reviews.</a>
<h3>Mushrooms</h3>
"Studies show that mushrooms increase the production and activity of white blood cells, making them more aggressive." This is a quote from Douglas Schar, DipPhyt, MCPP, MNIMH, director of the Institute of Herbal Medicine in Washington, DC.

The most efficient mushrooms for boosting your immunity are shiitake, maitake and reishi mushrooms.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-267 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/George-Foreman-GRP99-250x229.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="229" />A good way to improve your mushroom intake, besides an omelet or put it on a pizza, is to grill it, and for that you can use a George Foreman Grill (<a href="http://bestlife52.com/kitchen/largest-george-foreman-grill-with-removable-plates/">read my review</a>) which come with George Tough™ Triple non-stick coating which eliminates need for oil and it is very durable. As as matter of fact, it increases the flavor of the ingredient itself, if you are grilling a T-bone or a slice of mushroom, all you will get is the flavor of the meat or of the veggie itself.
<h3>Vitamin C</h3>
Vitamin C is well known as its power for fighting against a cold. That happens because it helps you develop your immune system through your white cells. <em>Yes, the white cells again</em>. And, as a matter of fact, when you think about vitamin C, you remember citrus fruits. But, we have other sources like bell peppers (sweet peppers), blackcurrants, broccoli, chili peppers, guava, kiwi, and parsley, for example. It is important for you to know that your body does not store vitamin C, so you need daily doses of it.
<p class="box"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-372 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Aicok-Masticating-Juicer-250x250.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" />Ensuring your daily vitamin intake with a fresh juice made with the Aicok Masticating Juicer/Extractor. Its lower speed (80rpm) extracts more vitamins, enzymes, minerals and trace minerals compared to a centrifugal juicer, meaning less foaming, which prevents oxidation, turning your juice healthier.
This Aicok Slow Masticating Juicer Extractor can accommodate fibrous vegetables such as celery and ginger, as well as leafy greens, so you will be able to add more healthy elements to your juice.

<h3>Garlic</h3>
Yes, I know it. It smells awful! But it is wonderful when the matter is about allergy due to its high concentration of <em>allicin</em>, a sulfur-containing compound. In addition to this, it is an effective agent for to fight against high blood pressure, cholesterol or heart attacks. And also helps you providing detox and cleansing abilities.

If you are concerned about your breath, I suggest you the BRI Nutrition Odorless Garlic. This is a 60-day supply of garlic oil 1,000 mg garlic oil.

<h3>Ginger</h3>
Ginger helps decrease inflammation by its bioactive substance gingerol. This is very effective against the oral bacteria linked to inflammatory diseases in gums, such as gingivitis and periodontitis. It may also be effective against the RSV virus, which is a common cause of respiratory infections. You can eat it in your food or get a ginger supplement (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00014EECK/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">see lowest price</a>).

And now other tips to manage symptoms:
<h2>Weather Forecast</h2>
Check out your local weather channel to find out when pollen is at its peak. Stay indoors, with the doors and windows closed whenever possible. And if it will be not possible, and you need to take a car, keep the windows rolled up as well.
<h2>Air Conditioning Maintenance</h2>
At the end of the summer, clean your air conditioning and change the filter, so you get rid of allergens or mold that will travel by air as soon as you turn it on again. Also, clean your AC unit with the Nu-Calgon 4171-75. It is self-rinsing, it liquefies dirt, grease, and other residues, and it is safe for use on metals and other surfaces since it is made with corrosion inhibitors. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00DM8KQ3I/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Read customer reviews here</a>.
<h2>Dehumidifier</h2>
Use a dehumidifier to keep your air between 35% and 50% humidity and prevent mold from growing. Mold, like dust mites, loves humid environments.
<p class="box"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-376 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Frigidaire-Energy-Star-Rated-Dehumidifier-250x250.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" />The Frigidaire FAD704DWD (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AU7GZXE/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">see lowest price</a>) protects your home from mold and mildew caused by excess moisture. It also helps to eliminate bacteria in the air that can make breathing difficult, by controlling the exact percentage of humidity in your room. Antibacterial mesh washable filter that also reduces room odors and other airborne particles. Low temperature operation saves energy and money, and it is Energy Star-rated too.</p>
Also ventilate your home regularly, especially the bathroom. This is good practice to prevent condensation. Cooking is a source of condensation as well, so pay attention to your kitchen too. If you see some mold around window sills, clean them up with a weak bleach solution.
<h2>Dust</h2>
Get rid of dust! Choose roller blinds or washable curtains and steam them regularly. Besides the steam cleaners, I want to suggest you one that is a fabric steamer, which can also be used as an iron because it has a built-in ironing board, plus it works very well on curtains.
<p class="box"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-307 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/PureSteam-Duo-Iron-and-Pressurized-Garment-Steamer-250x250.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" />The PureSteam Duo Iron &amp; Pressurized Garment Steamer gives you 30 minutes of steaming per tank. No need to stop working all the time to refill it. There are four fabric settings (synthetics, silk, wool, and cotton) to give you the best steam temperature and a safety cap to help with burn prevention. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M1N59IZ/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Click here</a> to see more details.</p>

<h2>HEPA Filter</h2>
Use a HEPA filter in your heating system and vacuum cleaner to remove pollen, mold, and other particles from the air. The Deik Cordless Vacuum Cleaner helps you get rid of bacteria and dust mites because of its HEPA and sponge filtration. Beyond this great protection against allergies, the Deik becomes a handheld vacuum cleaner and you can clean tight spaces. You can also vacuum clean high places because of its long, slim poles. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B071Y6JNT4/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Read customer reviews here.</a>
<h2>Rinse Your Nose</h2>
Our nose is a great filter and it helps us to maintain our immunity to healthy levels. You can keep it clean with an ancient nasal irrigation practice known as Neti. There is a Neti ceramic pot that is dishwasher safe and helps you with the best cleaning nasal irrigation. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B000OLEC6I/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Read reviews here</a> to find more details.
<h2>Air Purifier</h2>
And, if you live in an area that is too exposed to allergens, you can also adopt an air purifier to help you clean the air inside your home.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-380 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Honeywell-HHT-011-HEPA-Clean-Compact-Air-Purifier-250x200.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="200" />The best air purifiers use HEPA filters and the Honeywell HHP-011 (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000N9CPQK/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">see lowest price</a>) is great. It has 3 filtration levels:
<ol>
 	<li>Washable pre-filter lock in the large airborne particles,</li>
 	<li>Permanent HEPA-type filter that catches 95% of mold, spores, pet dander, smoke, pollen and dust, and</li>
 	<li>Ionizer that brings extra cleaning delivering fresh air.</li>
</ol>
So, enjoy all the fall benefits and Thanksgiving joy and protect yourself and your family from the allergy.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>30-Day Challenge: The 7-Minute Workout Routine</title>
		<link>http://bestlife52.com/?p=398</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I decided to challenge myself into exercising and building a healthier routine. I decided to follow the 7-minute workout routine during 30 days. My ultimate goal is to exercise every day for the rest of my life. Instead of feeling the weight of such a commitment, I decided to settle in for building the habit first, and take it from there.
<h2>What Do You Need?</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>floor space</li>
 	<li>chair</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Are The Exercises?</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>jumping jacks</li>
 	<li>planks</li>
</ol>
<h2>My 30-Day Journal</h2>
Here is a short blurb.
<h3>Day 1</h3>
I felt a bit overwhelmed by the pace of the exercises. I also assumed incorrectly that I already knew the exercises because I had followed a similar routine before, but there are lots of variations over the same theme. I liked the fact that everything is laid out in a single video, so I could pay attention to the exercises and forget about tracking the time. I also liked the fact that each exercise has tips on proper form, which is something I really lack - although the font is tiny and hard to read on my laptop screen while actually exercising. I felt good at the end.
<h3>Day 2</h3>
The actual exercises were ok and nothing came out of it. However, I did feel my muscles afterwards, when I went out for a walk with my parents. I could feel several muscles in my legs that were not activated quite often due to the "running stopped" routine. That felt good.
<h3>Day 3</h3>
After two nights of poor sleep, plus the muscle soreness, I almost gave up on exercising. However I woke up and exercised because I am really, really willing to make this work. 7 minutes is 0,5% of my day. If I cannot put that little time to myself, first thing in the morning, then when am I going to find the time to do it after life happens during the day?
<h3>Day 4</h3>
Still not enough sleep (only 5 hours), however it was easier to cope with the routine.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Pomegranate Benefits</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Pomegranate is my favorite fruit.

It is very different because its juice comes in little spheres, that pop up in your mouth when you chew it. Also, it is sweet with a little acid aftertaste and has a seed crunchy texture.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-442" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Pomegranate-Benefits.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="200" />
<h2>Very Special Health Properties</h2>
The juice has been studied for its healthy qualities as:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Vitamin C</strong>: the homemade fresh juice (and therefore non pasteurized) has 40% of Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for this vitamin.</li>
 	<li><strong>Antihypertensive and anti-inflammatory properties</strong>, 3 times more than green tea and red wine. It has <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23790554_Pomegranate_juice_A_heart-healthy_fruit_juice">potential cardioprotective benefits</a>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Flavonols</strong> for <a href="https://nccih.nih.gov/health/pomegranate/at-a-glance">arthritis and osteoporosis</a>.</li>
 	<li><strong>High concentration of antioxidants</strong>, which are <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2013/946298/">beneficial for oxidative stress, memory protection, and can be used to slow up the Alzheimer’s progress</a>.</li>
 	<li>Other vitamins and minerals: vitamin E, folate, potassium and vitamin K.</li>
</ul>
And, more recently, <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-04/bm-aas042617.php">scientists</a> <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/311572.php">are studying</a> a new molecule that can boost your muscles. The École Polytechnique Fédérale in Lausanne (EPFL) discovers that the pomegranate seeds releases a compound (urolithin A) that when digested by our intestinal bacteria it can restore muscle fatigue. It is a big relief when you don’t know how to handle with muscle chronic fatigue, by the medical classical way.
<h2>So, how I can seed and eat pomegranates?</h2>
There are two methods of peeling the fruit.
<h3>The Hard Way</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Cut the fruit in half and each half in 4 or 6 times without separating entirely the fruit.</li>
 	<li>Hold it over a bowl and gently, but firmly, hit the outside with a large spoon.</li>
 	<li>The seeds will eject. But you will always have some remaining stuck in the peel.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Easy Way</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Cut the fruit in half.<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-425" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Pomegranate-01-Cut-It-In-Half-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></li>
 	<li>Cut each half exactly where you find the white membranes.<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-426" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Pomegranate-02-A-Separate-The-Parts-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-427" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Pomegranate-02-B-Separate-The-Parts-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-428" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Pomegranate-02-C-Separate-The-Parts-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-429" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Pomegranate-02-D-Separate-The-Parts-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></li>
 	<li>When you separate these parts entirely from the external shell, the spheres will easily fall.<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-430" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Pomegranate-03-Get-The-Seeds-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></li>
 	<li>Instead of 10 minutes for to get the spherical seeds, you will take 2 or 3, like when you are peeling an orange.<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-431" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Pomegranate-04-Eat-It-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></li>
</ul>
Look at the pictures for better understanding.
<h2>How can I drink homemade pomegranate juice?</h2>
Homemade juice became quick and almost effortless. I used to peel the fruit and after that squeeze it through a potato masher, but the unstoppable squirts turn the process into a nightmare. And it was a task for about 12 - 15 minutes/cup, at least.

Now, I use a citrus juicer. It is almost the same process of an orange, but, as I don’t have to peel it anymore, it is almost instantaneous. Maybe you knew it already, but it is a save time trick that I wanted to share with you.

I took some pictures too, so you can see by yourself how easy the process is:

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-433" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Juice-01-A-Cut-It-In-Half-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-434" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Juice-01-B-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-435" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Juice-02-A-Squeeze-It-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-436" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Juice-02-B-Squeeze-It-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> <img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-437" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Juice-03-Drink-It-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />

Sometimes I eat it the little seed spheres in a salad. By its acid aftertaste, it will substitute lemon or vinegar in your sauce. And the crunchy texture can be your choice instead the croutons.

Well, knowing that unique seed properties, I have already increased its intake in my family's diet as it is its season.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Olive Leaf Tea Benefits</title>

<blockquote><em><strong>Olive Leaf Tea to get rid of the flu and make you more energized</strong></em></blockquote>
When Winter is at our door and becomes easier to catch a cold, you think how can you improve your immune system for to get away with the flu and face another day with a little more energy and power.

And once I start to research about natural immune boosts, one of the most powerful was the olive leaf as per its oil (oleuropein) and phytochemicals.

And all these substances which are responsible for its health protective functions are linked at the fact that olive trees are very resilient at their home habitat, fighting against insects and their poisons, bacteria, weeds and recently man-made air pollution. As a matter of fact, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-trees/olive-trees-of-gethsemane-among-oldest-in-world-study-idUSBRE89I0ZQ20121019">the olive trees in Gethsemane Garden in Jerusalem are among oldest in the world</a>, at least 900 years old and “yet despite their great age, the study showed the trees were in excellent health and had not been affected by lead pollution in the area”.

All this endurance power is carried through its fruits, olive oil, oleuropein and the other olive leaf components.

Everybody is well educated about the benefits of the olive oil and its health protective impacts as per its intake when following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_diet">Mediterranean Diet</a> that “include proportionally high consumption of olive oil, …”.

On the other hand, the use and effects of the olive leaf’s substances were registered as ancient times as the mummification of the pharaohs by the Egyptians and it has been used as a fever and malaria homemade remedy as registered in the Pharmaceutical Journal (1854 - England).

Besides its ability to “kill” microorganisms, as its potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties (like at the flu), various scientific studies with olive leaf extract at human may suggest that:
<ul>
 	<li>For hypertensive persons, its potency is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21036583">comparable to Captopril</a>;</li>
 	<li>Reaches up to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15333722">50% reduction in DNA damage</a>;</li>
 	<li>Its extract was <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X03012920">effective in inhibiting the acute HIV infection, also preventing the virus’ replication inside the cells</a>, without toxicity on healthy cells;</li>
 	<li>It has antioxidant effects to <a href="http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/10966200260398152">protect against radiation damage</a>.</li>
</ul>
Preventive recommended dosage for LDL (good cholesterol) oxidation is as low as 10 mg (as you can get in extra virgin olive oil) and a safe supplemental olive leaf’s dosage is about a daily intake of 500-1000mg.

The main contraindications are the oleuropein interaction with blood thinning medication as aspirin or any prescription medication. Another possible interaction is if you are taking insulin because it can reduce the glucose levels in your blood.

And as per its bitter taste, oleuropein has liver detox properties. So, it can cause some headaches and/or diarrhea as well.

Another side effect experienced by people who have access to oleuropein is an energy enhancement. Even those who don’t are illness, that is a good news.

I choose to benefit myself and my family by olive leaf tea and being very blessed for to have some olive trees near home, so we are drinking it every day. So keep your <a href="http://bestlife52.com/health/new-seasons-allergies/">electric kettle</a> around you and enjoy the benefits of the olive leaf.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The other day I read something that resonated with me. Here it is, freely quoted:
<blockquote>Do you believe you are hungry?

Here, have an apple.

No? Feeling like eating something else?

In that case, my friend, you are not hungry. You are either thirsty or bored.

You are not fat because you have a poor, slow metabolism. You are not fat due to poor genetics. You are not fat due to lack of time to exercise.

You are fat because you cannot keep your mouth shut. You eat more calories than those you burn. You drink way too many soft drinks. Your portions are too big.</blockquote>
Facts are facts. Count your calories and see it for yourself. You could be losing weight now, without even making exercises, by learning about Basal Metabolic Rate:
<ol>
 	<li>Calculate your own BMR with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate">metric units</a> or <a href="http://raylcross.net/engWeight/index.html">imperial units</a>.</li>
 	<li>Once you find your own (mine, for example, is 2,661 kcal/day), start eating less than that amount every day.</li>
</ol>
That is it. You will lose weight without doing anything else because your body will need to burn these 2,661 kcal to keep you breathing, warm, pumping blood, and so on.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Miso Benefits</title>
		<link>http://bestlife52.com/?p=488</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2017 15:33:32 +0000</pubDate>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-491" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Miso-Benefits.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="200" />
<blockquote>Miso soup: helps on hypertension, cancer and radiation injury</blockquote>
Comfort food, to me, is all about the psychological feeling of my childhood, and, in some occasion, because it remembers me like a sense of belonging, as when I am at home.

One of the best comfort foods ever is miso soup: the quiet heat of the smoking salty bowl makes me feel a cozy sensation of warm filling up.

As I am becoming gratefully addicted to learning about food health benefits, I got the chance to read a lot of scientific studies about miso and here are my findings:
<h2>What Is Miso?</h2>
Essentially, miso is fermented soybean paste used as a condiment in East Asia.

Miso is widely used in Japan and throughout Asia. Each country has slightly different ways to make it, like using a different soy variety, as well as mixing soy, for example, with fermented rice or oats in different proportions. The result is also visual: you will find miso in different colors (white, yellow, and red) and as it is used in a particular local way, it reflects the regional cuisine taste and tradition.

Obviously, it is ideal if you can use miso you utilize is from an organic, non-GMO soybean - as a side note, almost 94% of all soy grown in the US today is GMO! And as per the research, the more positive effects belong to the miso’s longest fermentation period, because you will have access to live probiotic that will help you to balance the fight against pollution, oxidative stress, toxins, etc.

About the fermentation period, it can vary from 2 months (white miso) to up to 3 years (red miso). So, if you choose a red one, by its concentrated flavor, you shall use it with parsimony, once its taste can overlap all others in your recipe.

When buying organic non-GMO miso, it is better to keep it in the refrigerator, for to maintain its fermentation effect.

One important issue is about if you are soy allergic - soybeans and foods with it as an ingredient are among the top 10 major food allergens in the US). However, at least in one Korean scientific study of P34 protein (one of the primary allergenic protein in soy), showed almost undetectable traces of this protein, making miso potentially with less allergic risk from other soy food sources.
<h2>What Are Miso's Benefits For Health?</h2>
Miso is a condiment that contains many goodies:
<ul>
 	<li>vitamins (B12, E and K),</li>
 	<li>folic acid,</li>
 	<li>salts,</li>
 	<li>vegetable protein,</li>
 	<li>essential minerals (copper, zinc, manganese),</li>
 	<li>fat, and</li>
 	<li>carbohydrates</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

One little word about K vitamin: if you are thinking about enhance its intake by the bond protective effects and it is difficult to have this information clearly disclosed in miso’s packing, you would prefer Chinese miso, which uses <em>Bacillus subilis</em> which is one of the microorganisms responsible for to develop this vitamin on miso’s fermentation.

And, by the way, you can use miso in other receipts beyond soup and you can try it, for instance, in a cucumber salad. And you can mix miso with apple vinegar for achieving an acid aftertaste. It is refreshing and you will eat raw miso, which is the healthiest way, taking advantage of all fermented microorganisms. Yummy!

Its health benefits are being researched and considered from preventing cancers to order intestinal function and helping digestion as protection against gastric ulcer, decreasing blood pressure and cholesterol. It has been disclosed as well as preventing fatigue and inflammation.

And about other protective effects, the first registered fact that miso has radiation protection effects was after the 2nd atomic bomb was dropped in Nagasaki (August 9th, 1945) when physician Tatuichiro Akizuki with 20 employees took care of 70 tuberculosis patients at “Uragami Daiichi Hospital”, about 1,4 km away from the bomb’s hypocenter, but none of these people have any acute radiation disease. Dr. Akizuki defines that wakame seaweed miso soup, which they consumed every day, had radioprotective effects.

<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3695331/">Another scientific experiment</a> also confirmed miso’s radiation protection action, as well as by its preventive impact on large intestine cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, gastric tumors and hepatic tumor.

What is concerned about hypertension, the study revealed that 2 or more bowls of miso soup have preventive benefits. Even though miso is a salty condiment, the scientists found that the salt in it, by its fermentation and, therefore, bioavailability, doesn’t have a negative impact on the arterial blood tension.
<h2>How Can I Eat Miso?</h2>
Other than the cucumber salad that I mentioned above, I also like to eat miso soup ("miso shiru"). I will start with an almost plain receipt and growing in flavor and health uses - here is how I make it:
<h3>Simple Miso Soup</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>peel and slice a carrot, or ¼ of a Japanese white radish if you have access to it, and cook it in water (1,5 l) until the veggies are cooked</li>
 	<li>turn off the stove and add 1 soup spoon of miso</li>
 	<li>sprinkle the soup with fresh sliced chives (chives have calcium and iron and are rich in vitamins A and C).</li>
 	<li>This first miso soup version is my favorite to substitute a mug of tea. By avoiding caffeine, it is warm, healthy drink to have before bedtime.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Add Some Protein (1 of 3):</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>if you need a light entrée a poached egg-like is a good protein addition to the simple version</li>
 	<li>the poached way to add the egg to the soup will give the pleasure to individuate another flavor in the soup</li>
 	<li>if you like eggs, but not so much a fan of the egg yolk flavor, you can stir the egg and you will have a weak taste of it</li>
</ul>
<h3>Add Some Protein (2 of 3):</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>for those who are vegetarian, you can use some tofu in small cubes</li>
 	<li>certainly, it is even lighter than the egg version but it will kill your hunger with this protein boost</li>
</ul>
<h3>Add Some Protein (3 of 3):</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>if you are looking for something to get rid of the flu, make a chicken broth and, with it, a miso soup. It will bring an inner warmth</li>
 	<li>I myself substitute the flu medicine for this chicken miso soup. It always works!</li>
</ul>
All these recipes can be done with a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/kitchen/best-multi-use-rice-cooker/">multi-purpose rice cooker</a>.

I hope you enjoy your next miso soup as per its countless health benefits and great Asian flavor.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="box"><strong>The 30-Second Verdict</strong>:
<img class="size-full wp-image-527 alignright" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Aroma-ARC-150SB-rice-and-steaming-tray.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="335" />The Aroma ARC-150SB is a <strong>great bargain</strong>, capable of cooking white or brown rice while <strong>also steaming vegetables or meats</strong>, as well as <em>cooking roasts, stews, jambalayas, chili, and even quinoa</em>.
It is a <strong>very flexible small appliance with a high capacity</strong> (20 cups of cooked rice). In addition to all that, the 15-hour delay timer allows you to place all ingredients inside the cooker and choose when you would like to have the meal done. It will then beep once the meal is ready and automatically switch to Keep Warm mode, meaning that even if you or your family are delayed to start eating for whatever reason, your meal will be kept at just the right temperature for up to another 8 hours. <strong>Can you imagine having a personal chef on demand after a long day at work?</strong>
The value offered here is also unbeatable. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0055FSN0Y?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Click here to see Amazon's great price</a> or keep on reading my Aroma ARC-150SB review if you want more details.</p>
If you like rice and you tried to cook it at home, you know it can be a chore. Between adjusting just the right temperature at the stove and watching the cook time, it simply takes away part of your attention that could be directed towards cooking other dishes or tidying up the kitchen before the meal.

This is why today I am writing this Aroma 20-cup rice cooker review - more specifically, the ARB-150SB model, which is also a food steamer and a slow cooker. Put simply, it offers great value for the money. You can set it and forget it by simply touching a button.
<h2>Uses</h2>
If you are not familiar with a rice cooker, they are a *staple* in Asian families - pardon the pun!

A rice cooker will, most essentially, cook rice - be it white or brown. This is how you can also always eat your fluffy and warm rice at just the right temperature, even if it takes you 10 or 15 extra minutes to gather everyone around the table, because these cookers automatically switch to Heat mode once the cooking is done.

This Aroma ARB-150SB, however, has a few other tricks up its sleeve.

First of all, due to its large capacity, it steams meats and veggies on top of your rice while you cook it below. That means you only have one pan to wash, reduce and control your nutrient intake (and count them macros!), and manage only one appliance for your entire meal.

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-524" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ARC-150SB-chili.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="335" />You can also use its Slow Cook function to prepare roasts, stews, chilis, and even jambalayas. If you cook a bigger portion, you can freeze part of your meal and have a quick, homemade meal when you are short on time.

This added flexibility for almost no extra space is excellent for college students on a budget, people cooking at home under a time constraint, and also folks who have small kitchens and little to no countertop availability.
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Dedicated menus for White Rice and Brown Rice</strong>. Preparing a full batch to 20 cups of cooked white rice takes only 35 minutes. Just make sure to rinse the rice prior to cooking it, since it helps avoid caramelizing the bottom layer of the rice. Rinsing the rice also removes the excess starchiness, which would have to be washed from the cooker after using it anyways.</li>
 	<li><strong>Slow Cook function</strong>, which can be used for preparing roasts, chilies, jambalayas, stews, soups, and so on. Its capacity is 4 quart (3.8 liter) and it can be programmed for up to 10 hours – a pot roast takes around 4 hours of your unsupervised time, meaning you can do something else and let the rice cooker do its job.</li>
 	<li><strong>Delay Timer</strong>, when combined with the three previous menus, so you can load your rice cooker with all ingredients and leave for work early in the morning, and arrive back later in the evening to a fully cooked meal.</li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-526" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Aroma-ARC-150SB-details-773x1024.jpg" alt="" width="773" height="1024" />
<ul>
 	<li>Should you be late, the <strong>Keep Warm kicks in automatically</strong> and you will still eat a freshly cooked meal at just the right temperature for up to 8 hours.</li>
 	<li>You can set the <strong>Delay Timer</strong> for up to 15 hours, meaning you can place all ingredients inside your cooker early in the morning and come back home in the evening to a warm, homemade meal. Much <em><strong>healthier and cheaper than ordering takeout food</strong></em>, plus you get to control portion sizes.</li>
 	<li>Due to its <strong>bigger size</strong> and the presence of a <strong>steaming tray</strong>, you can <em><strong>easily prepare one-pot meals</strong></em> and steam seafood, chicken, veggies on the upper tray at the same time you cook rice. <em>How is that for practicality?</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Additional Features</h2>
You can also use this rice cooker to cook quinoa and millet by following these simple steps:
<ol>
 	<li>Soak the cereal overnight in the cooker and it will sprout.</li>
 	<li>Rinse it the next morning and cook it normally.</li>
 	<li>Done!</li>
</ol>
Your quinoa (or millet) will be much fluffier and tastier. The soaking process also removes the excessive bitterness from quinoa.
<h2>Performance</h2>
The performance is <strong>stellar</strong>. My reasoning is purely based on the cost-benefit ratio offered here.

Consider that you can prepare rice for your entire family, plus the eventual guest, in around 35 minutes and forget about it while cooking something else entirely.

Ensuring perfect results comes from 3 simple steps:
<ol>
 	<li>Accurately measure the rice using the provided cup.</li>
 	<li>Rinse the rice to remove the excess starch and avoid caramelizing the bottom layer.</li>
 	<li>Measure the water until the corresponding level for the amount of rice you placed in the cooker – there is a level written inside the inner pan and this is the most accurate way of measuring the rice-to-water ratio.</li>
</ol>
You can also use this rice cooker as a slow cooker and prepare stews, chilis, soups, and even jambalayas. Make a bigger stews the first few times and freeze a portion. <em>This way you can have homemade, healthy, superfast meals ready to go without any extra effort.</em>
<h2>Unboxing</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-529" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Aroma-ARC-150SB-unboxing.jpg" width="296" height="267" />

The box that arrives to your home weighs 8.6 lbs (3.9 kg). The rice cooker itself weighs 5 lbs (2.2 kg). Moving it around is easy because the lid has a good handle on top.

<img class="size-full wp-image-525 alignright" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Aroma-ARC-150SB-accessories.jpg" width="335" height="335" />

Once you open your box, you will find the rice cooker, the accessories – measuring cup, steam tray, and serving spatula – and the documentation – user manual and warranty.

You can store all the accessories inside the rice cooker when you are not using it, which can both save space and simplify your life by leaving all things handy when you decide to use your rice cooker.
<h2>Dimensions</h2>
The rice cooker’s height and length are 10.8 in (274 mm) and width is 11.8 in (300 mm).

That means it will use approximately half the depth of the average kitchen counter space (the standard is 25 in/635 mm deep) and leave you enough room in front of the rice cooker for a cutting board or a plate.
<h2>Pros</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Versatility</strong>. You can cook white or brown rice and steam food at the same time. You can also use it as a slow cooker. You can also cook quinoa.</li>
 	<li><strong>Easy to clean</strong>. The inner cooking pot has a high-quality non-stick material.</li>
 	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong>. You can carry it from the place where you store it to your kitchen counter.</li>
 	<li><strong>Compact</strong>. If you use it daily like me, I always leave it on my counter and it doesn't feel cumbersome at all.</li>
 	<li><strong>Easy to use</strong>. The digital controls are simple to use and set.</li>
 	<li><strong>Unbeatable price</strong>. More than being one of the cheapest models currently for sale, when you consider its capacity size and features, buying one of these simply makes sense.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Un-detachable inner lid</strong>. That is less practical, since the vast majority of competitors allow you to remove the inner lid and wash it separately. Here you either clean it as soon as the rice is ready, and all the “rice gumminess” is still warm and easy to clean, or you do it after your meal, and fight with dry rice starch.</li>
 	<li><strong>Power cord length</strong>. It is somewhat short. On the other hand, the excess cord does not dangle around your counter, so that is definitely a matter of perspective.</li>
 	<li><strong>Plastic steaming tray</strong>. I am nitpicking here but I have to mention it. If you steam certain veggies such as carrots, they will dye the plastic.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cost-Benefit Ratio</h2>
In one word? Great!

It is a well-known fact that you will <em>save money by making your own meals at home</em> instead of going out to a restaurant, but think about it – having friends at home and cooking your meal in your huge rice cooker saves you money <em>and</em> gives you a different scenario for your social life.

Plus you get to <strong>fully control the quality of your ingredients and portion sizes</strong>, which is good for your health too.

One dinner a week and by the end of the month this baby will have already paid itself.
<p class="box"><strong>My Final Opinion:</strong>
This is <em>one of the best appliances I have reviewed so far</em>. It has a <strong>great capacity</strong>, while not being too cumbersome on the kitchen counter.
It is <strong>flexible</strong> enough to prepare much more than white and brown rice, such as quinoa, soups, stews, roasts, jambalayas, and even chili. I can also <em>steam vegetables and meats while cooking rice</em>, which <strong>helps me cut prep time and pot washing afterwards</strong>.
I also order takeout much less often, so I <strong>save money and control the quality of the ingredients I eat</strong>.
The 15-hour delay timer ensures that I can preset all ingredients whenever I have time and choose the time when my meal will be ready – by which time it sounds a beep and auto-switches to Keep Warm function, just in case I am not around for any reason. <strong>It feels like having a personal chef after a long day of work</strong>.

		<title>Eat Tastier, Healthier, Faster, And Cheaper With The GeekChef</title>
		<link>http://bestlife52.com/?p=532</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="box"><img class="size-medium wp-image-279 alignright" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/GeekChef-Multi-Functional-Electric-Pressure-Cooker-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />If you are looking for a cheaper Instant Pot alternative, this GeekChef Electric Pressure Cooker review is just for you. You will:
- Eat tastier food,
- Eat more vitamins and nutrients using quality ingredients of your choice,
- Save time on food prep,
- Save money by ordering less takeout food, and
- Save space on small kitchen counters.
The GeekChef offers a lot of value for <strong>significantly less money than the Instant Pot</strong>. If you are like me and also have fun while cooking, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0X67O0?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">see current prices now on Amazon</a> or keep on reading my review below.</p>

<h2>Uses</h2>
Although the GeekChef Electric Pressure Cooker gives away its main function in its name, it is much more than that, it has 12 preset functions built in – and without needing to pay extra for accessories such as with the main competition.

The 12 functions are divided in:
<ul>
 	<li>Pressure
<ul>
 	<li>Rice: faster than a normal rice cooker</li>
 	<li>Poultry</li>
 	<li>Bean/Chili: preparing beans, chili, lentils</li>
 	<li>Soup/Porridge</li>
 	<li>Canning</li>
 	<li>Potato</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Non-Pressure
<ul>
 	<li>Slow Cook</li>
 	<li>Sous Vide</li>
 	<li>Sauté: for sautéing, browning, or simmering</li>
 	<li>Steam: steaming vegetables/seafood, or reheating food</li>
 	<li>Yogurt: making yogurt and pasteurizing milk</li>
 	<li>Pasta: cooking pasta, noodles, spaghetti, and so on</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Plus the Insulation Warmer function, which makes a 13th pre-programmed mode.
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Super versatile</strong>. Lots of features packed as compact as a medium sauce pot.</li>
 	<li><strong>Easy to use</strong>. The machine automatically adjusts the pressure settings for each food while cooking. There is no need to make manual adjustments.</li>
 	<li><strong>Safe</strong>. The GeekChef has many safety mechanisms such as a lid liner, floating valve, and the anti-block shield. It is also built with heavy-gauge steel. Its AC cord sustains high heat and built to American electrical standards.</li>
 	<li><strong>Saves time and money</strong>. It is perfect for our busy and modern lifestyles because it allows you to can cook up to 70% faster than normal. You adjust cooking times for all preset programs, as well as the temperature for Sous Vide and Saute modes.</li>
 	<li><strong>Sous Vide</strong>. This is the only pressure cooker with a sous vide mode. Cook your food evenly keeping all its juices and moisture. The temperature range is 120-175 °F (49-80 °C), the default is 140 °F (60 °C), and the adjust increment is 10 °F (5.5 °C). The time range is 1-12h, the default time is 6h, and the adjust increment is 30 min.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Additional Feature</h2>
<strong>The pressure can be released in two forms</strong>: on its own once the cooking cycle is finished or manually through a release in just a few seconds.
<h2>Performance</h2>
The 12 cooking modes are pressured and non-pressured.

First-time users can easily prepare rice as in a normal rice cooker; meats of all sorts with both the meat option for normal cooking or the poultry option when you need a higher cooking temperature; curry and lentils with the chili/beans menu; and even fish using the steam function.

Most users can figure out the menus and cooking times quickly, in one or two uses, depending on the degree of complexity of the dish you choose to prepare.
<h2>Unboxing</h2>
Open the box and you will find the GeekChef, with its industrial design and stainless steel finish.

The overall look is very elegant and will add plenty of style to any kitchen counter.

Accessories include:
<ul>
 	<li>stainless steel steam rack with a handle,</li>
 	<li>measuring cup (especially important for measuring rice accurately),</li>
 	<li>soup spoon, and</li>
 	<li>BPA-free plastic rice spatula.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dimensions</h2>
The package that arrives to your home measures 14.8 x 13.3 x 13 in (37.5 x 33.7 x 33 cm) and weights 13.85 lb (6.3 kg). The GeekChef itself weights 10.2 lb (4.6 kg).

In practical terms, <strong>its size is similar to a medium-sized sauce pan</strong>.

The cord length is 36 in (91.4 cm), long enough for comfortable use.

As for the internal volume, you can use it for canning 4 jars at a time with 1/2 qt capacity (473 ml), each sized 2 3/4 x 5 1/8 in (7x13 cm).
<h2>Pros</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Time saver</strong>. Leave it all prepped in the morning and use the slow cook function, or use the pressure cooker when you come home from work – either way you will eat a homemade, warm, delicious meal.</li>
 	<li><strong>Work smarter</strong>. Gather your kitchen scraps and bones and use the slow cook function to simmer it all for 12 hours. No need to watch the burner for having homemade beef stock!</li>
 	<li><strong>Glass lid</strong>. This GeekChef version includes a glass lid, meaning you can see what you are cooking while you use the slow cooking mode.</li>
 	<li><strong>Extra flavor and practicality</strong>: Brown your ingredients using the Saute function, then add the liquid, deglaze, and then switch to Slow Cook mode. Tastier and more convenient.</li>
 	<li><strong>Easy to clean</strong>. This is important because it ensures that the GeekChef gets used more often, instead of cluttering up your home until your next garage sale or salvation army donation. The inner pot is made of stainless steel and can go safely to the dishwasher. Cleaning the lid is also easy – just detach the splash guard and you can clean both the lid and the silicone seal.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Poor quality instructions manual</strong>. It is not helpful and does not provide many details. On the other hand, the GeekChef is easy to use and has intuitive menus, so most users solve this issue by trial and error with their recipes. As for recipes themselves, it is easy to find them on Google by searching for instant pot recipes.</li>
 	<li><strong>Small pressure canner</strong>. If you want to can bigger containers, be aware that you cannot use pint size jars because the GeekChef is not deep enough for those. It is a quality pressure canner, however you will be restricted to half-pint cans.</li>
 	<li><strong>Unflexible cooking cycle times</strong>. For some recipes, the pre-programmed cycle times are longer than what you need – and you cannot adjust them. In this case, you have to set a timer and manually shut off the GeekChef when you wish.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cost-Benefit Ratio</h2>
The GeekChef provides substantial value, unmatched by its main competitor. If you want to buy a similar Instant Pot, you will then need to buy extra accessories and spend a lot more to get similar functionality.

While the GeekChef isn’t perfect, its many pros certainly overweight its few cons and ensure this is a great purchase, likely to be used for a long time in your kitchen.
<p class="box">The way I see it, the GeekChef works really well for two types of people:
1-) Busy people like me who like to eat warm homemade meals and need to save time on food prep and save money ordering less takeout food; and
2-) People like me who need to save space on small kitchen counters and like to have fun while cooking.
(Yeah, I overlap the two groups.)
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-279" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/GeekChef-Multi-Functional-Electric-Pressure-Cooker.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1000" />What can I say? The <strong>GeekChef Electric Pressure Cooker is the way to go</strong>.
You can make rice (faster than a normal electric rice cooker), chili, beans, lentils, curry, easy-to-peel hard boiled eggs, steamed seafood and veggies, sous vide steaks, yogurt.... And so much more.
This is how versatile this machine is, and this is why I ordered one for myself.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[How to improve your bedroom organization and increase your wardrobe space? How to own the best closet ever?

I dreamed so many times of having a walk-in closet. Now that I have one, I can tell you that it is a great help to organize myself when getting ready in the morning. My bedroom is always organized, which is a time saver and helps me decrease my stress.
<p class="box">The best complete solution for your closet is this <strong>Rubbermaid Configurations Deluxe Kit</strong>. There is no need to cut anything to make it yours. You can install it with your home tools! Watch the video below and see how simple it is:
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EllevTI5BDA?rel=0" width="448" height="252" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe>
It is a great cost benefit too, especially considering the entire kit (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0X67O0/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">see the price here</a>).</p>
If you don’t have a walk-in closet, you can save time too by organizing and maintaining the bedroom neat if your wardrobe is in order.

So, if you are thinking about redoing your closet, keep in mind the following:
<h2>Elements Of A Good Closet</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Rods for long or short hanging items and to hang ties and belts,</li>
 	<li>Open shelves of various heights (12 to 16 inches wide will fit all your jeans, t-shirts and sweaters),</li>
 	<li>Drawers for the little and tiny things like accessories, and</li>
 	<li>A spot for shoes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reach-In Closet</h2>
This is also known as a one-wall closet. It is the most common type of bedroom closet and once you need the opening being the wider as possible, use sliders doors or bifold doors. 24 inches is the minimum depth for a wall closet within interior walls and the width of a closet or two or more doors should be 60 inches, at least.
<h2>Use The Hallway</h2>
You can use the hallway between your bedroom and bathroom. I particularly see a hallway as a waste of space, but if you have one like this, you can add some shelves, clothing rods and drawers and avail it in full.

<strong>Measurement tips</strong>: on one side of the hallway you create a hang down zone of 24 inches depth; on the opposite side you can put some drawers and shelves with 18 inches depth, and the running space you will need have to have at least 35.5 inches.
<h2>Behind Your Bed</h2>
You can put your closet behind the bed and use the entire width of the room for to create a closet even if it won’t be a walking in type.
<h2>Repurpose A Room</h2>
And, the best for the last: transform another room, preferably next door to the bedroom, in a walking in closet. For one with U distribution design, you will need 5.9 x 5.9 feet.
<h2>Rubbermaid Configurations Custom Closet Deluxe Kit</h2>
<p class="box"><img class="alignleft wp-image-310 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Rubbermaid-Configurations-Custom-Closet-Deluxe-Kit-250x250.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" />Installing this kit is very easy and simple, with tools that you probably already own, plus you don't need to cut anything. It fits closet spaces between 4 to 8 feet wide, up to 22 inches high. It contains a rack that gives you instant, custom-made organization by adding 20 feet of shelving space (13 inches deep) and 12 feet of hanging space with expanding shelves and telescoping rods.
Out of all the models that are screwed in the wall, this Rubbermaid kit is the simplest to assemble and friendliest to fit because you don’t cut anything to suit your needs.

<h2>Whitmore Freestanding Double Rod Closet</h2>
<p class="box"><img class="wp-image-304 size-medium aligncenter" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Whitmor-Double-Rod-Freestanding-Closet-197x250.jpg" alt="" width="197" height="250" />The Whitmore can be used in a closet or also as a storage unit.

<h2>Travel Garment Steamer For Your Closet</h2>

And if you have a small laundry, you should consider getting the PureSteam Duo Iron, a garment steamer with built-in ironing board and hanger with clips. It has a very compact footprint, plus it heats up quickly. The price floats often, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M1N59IZ/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">see the price here</a>. This way you will have an excellent laundry system to take care of your clothing and you will make an excellent use of your space.</p>

<h2>Other Useful Tips To Organize Your Closet</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Curtain</strong>: you can hide your rack-type closet with a ceiling-to-floor curtain, giving the sense of organization by separating two areas of the same room. This way you can take away the stressful view of an open closet, plus you protect your clothes and shoes from the dust as well. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015SJ7RYY/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">These curtains</a> are machine washable, so they are also easy to maintain and keep clean.</li>
 	<li><strong>Baskets</strong>: adding baskets is an easy way to organize the loose items on your shelves. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXWX99P/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">These cubes</a> are also an interesting option because they have lids to keep their contents clean. The cutout handles are lined with metal, so they are easy to carry and pull off and out of shelves. And they are very fashionable as well in soft grey or natural brown accents for a neutral color scheme.</li>
 	<li><strong>Hanger</strong>: to help you to focus your sight on your clothes, you may choose a single color uniform style hanger. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TPABCH6/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">These hangers</a> are a good choice, and for a good price too.</li>
 	<li><strong>Shelving</strong>. Above 6.5 feet (approximately 2 meters), you can settle some bridge-like shelves, even if you have doors or windows, for to keep your suitcases or duvets, so you use all the height you have.</li>
 	<li><strong>Mirror</strong>. Remember that a mirror (preferably a big one) is a must near your wardrobe or in your closet. If you don’t want to hang one, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0038FFWJ8/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">this cheval mirror</a> is a great option.</li>
 	<li><strong>Lighting</strong>: instead of complicating your life by changing fixtures, you can take a simpler route and use built-in lights. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XNYL7GP/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">This model</a> has a motion sensor and can be simply stuck anywhere you choose.</li>
 	<li><strong>Hampers</strong>: so, everything is all about you having everything organized for getting ready every day faster and stress-free, so it is appropriate to have a hamper to collect your laundry. This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IG6C0D4/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">foldable laundry hamper</a> can help you with that.</li>
</ul>
After all this planning and efforts to make your closet the best experience to dress daily, I can assure you that will be a fun time as well to reach all your clothes and shoes and accessories effortless and, better than that, when you go out, everything will remain arranged and fixed up.

		<title>How To Keep Clean Floors At Home?</title>
		<link>http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/how-to-keep-clean-floors-at-home/</link>

		<dc:creator><![CDATA[Marcia]]></dc:creator>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-444" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/How-To-Best-Clean-Your-Floors.jpg" width="564" height="200" />

Cleaning the floor isn’t my thing as I prefer to cook, but it needs to be done. And, because it isn’t my favorite chore, I studied it deeply, so it can become easier, more efficient, and, so to speak, "fun". In my case, I found out that doing it every day makes it easier, and so I spend less time cleaning floors.

So, you already know that you need to sweep or vacuum, scrub a stain and polish the floor, not particularly in this sequence, and you need to do it over and over again.

Long story short, here is the result of my research, starting with simple manual gadgets and going through the electric complex ones:
<h2>Best Mop</h2>
You can use a mop to dust picking up dry, loose dust, sand or hair from the floor and in a second step, you can go to wet mop to dissolve and pull out dried-in liquid or fat or even mud pollution.
<p class="box"><img class="size-medium wp-image-415 alignleft" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Microfiber-Wholesale-300x94.jpg" width="300" height="94" /><strong>Microfiber Wholesale</strong> – it is a dry and wet professional mop. Microfiber cleans better and more than cotton mops (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KAIU6BA/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">see the price</a>.)
My first choice goes to Microfiber Wholesale because it does the job in a professional level with 18” microfiber flat mop to do the dry and the wet steps giving sparkling finish on laminate, tile, hardwood and stone flooring without a mop bucket. You can clean around and under the furniture, thanks to a 360 degree swivel heavy-duty aluminum frame.
Another good feature is the 4- to 6-feet stainless steel handle, which allows you to fit it to your height in order to avoid the need to bend over to clean the floor.
And you can prevent the use of chemicals that can cause allergy to your kids or pets, adding some apple cider vinegar when you do the wet phase of cleaning. You will save money from your machine-washable Mojave Microfiber Dust Mop and the Premium Microfiber Wet Mop pads as they will last hundreds of washings.</p>
<img class="wp-image-419 size-medium aligncenter" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/O-Cedar-UltraMAX-Microfiber-Flat-Mop-And-Bucket-Kit-250x250.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" />Perhaps you don’t have a sink near where you need to clean and you prefer to have a bucket, so the option is O-Cedar UltraMAX Microfiber Flat Mop &amp; Bucket Kit (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TUEVY7K/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">see the price here</a>). Its microfiber pad has unmatched PowerZone that helps you to eliminate the most impregnable dirt by scrubbing it and maintaining your hands dry. Its telescopic handle is very handy (though it isn’t longer than the Microfiber Wholesale) and it has a 180 degrees swivel head for your comfort when cleaning under the bed, for example. The bucket has an innovative squeezer design that offers an optimum humidity level for a great cleaning.

<img class="wp-image-420 size-medium aligncenter" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Bissell-PowerFresh-Pet-Steam-Mop-85x250.jpg" alt="" width="85" height="250" />You can choose an electrical mop if you want spare a little your elbow and, in this case, the winner is the Bissell Powerfresh Steam Mop (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0091YYUAM/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">see all about it here</a>). In my opinion, the best about it is the steam: you don’t have to use more chemicals and you will have a sanitized clean floor that will help you even with the allergies’ triggers. Among other great features like cleaning dried-on sticky messes very fast by its variable steam control and it has a removable water tank and a good long power cor. Its low-profile head will fit beside toilets and reach small spaces.
<p class="box"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-414 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ILIFE-Mop-Robot-250x250.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" /><strong>Best choice</strong>:
If you prefer a mop robot, you can go for ILIFE V5s Pro Robot Vacuum Mop Cleaner with Water Tank. (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X1F3HXG/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">See the price here</a>.)
It is an ideal choice for hard floors (wood or tile, marble or laminate) and you can use it in for to dry vacuum or wet mopping.
About the vacuuming: I learned in the reviews it is pretty much efficient with hair and pet fur. You can program it for a scheduling clean, preset the work or auto-clean time (randomly). Another two modes are edge clean that run along the wall sides and spot clean that will deep clean in a special dirty area.
Its battery will last for up to 140 minutes and it docks and recharges automatically being always ready to run.
The ILIFE V5s Pro Robot has a front obstacle sensor in order to safeguard your furniture and a cliff sensor to prevent it from falling off stairs. It also climbs to a maximum of 15 degrees and can clean under spaces with a minimum height of 10mm or 3/8 in.
Another important health feature is that it brings a HEPA filter, which helps you to prevent allergies.</p>

<h2>Best Broom/Sweeper</h2>
Dust mops offer the best, lasting results for floor cleaning. If you choose not to use a dust mop, a sweeper is the second best. Next, you will find my choices:

LuckyFine 360 Rotary Automatic Hand Push Sweeper (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073QT8FGK/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">check it here</a>) uses no electricity or batteries. It has two circle corner brushes that pick up the little dust particles and all kind of hair and fur on flat flooring (wood, plastic, ceramic tile, and marble, but it can’t be used on carpet). LuckFine reaches 98% places (excluded narrow spaces) and its adjustable ABS handle helps you to clean without bending and it can be shortened, so it is suitable for children also and they will help you to do the chores with some fun. Another great feature is that it seals the dirt inside internal dustpan, being more practical for you to go to the garbage bin without messing around when finishing the cleaning.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-421 size-large" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Leifheit-11410-Classic-Manual-Rotaro-Carpet-Sweeper-with-Natural-Brushes-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="557" />Another option, in case you have hard floor and carpet in your home, is the Leifheit Rotaro Sweeper (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00063FD76/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">see the price here</a>). It is mechanical too, so you don’t need to use electricity. It gathers a strong main brush with 2 other corner ones and is perfect for low-pile rugs and carpets because of its adjustable knob brush-height. The Rotaro Sweeper has its internal dustpan as well which is easy to empty and a flat-lying hand, so you can clean low spots under the furniture. And it has a brush comb to clear debris and hair from the brushes, so it can be better effective in sweeping all the dirt.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-418 size-large" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Bissell-CleanView-Upright-Vacuum-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="557" />You can also learn if vacuuming is your main concern with Bissel CleanView Upright Vacuum (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AZBIZTW/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">read all about it here</a>). Its OnePass Technology with nonstop powerful suction and its modern brush design provides you with more cleaning on the very first pass. This model comes with an Easy Empty Dirt Tank so you save money instead of buying disposable bags. And add to this easy dirt bin, you will find the washable filter that provides you an easy and fast maintenance. You can use the TurboBrush Tool for upholstery, furniture, and stairs, so your cleaning will be total.

And a little last piece of advice: always think on buying extra microfiber mop, in order to be ready to clean more than one room at a time, or HEPA filter, so you prevent allergies better.
<p class="box"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-414" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ILIFE-Mop-Robot.jpg" width="300" height="300" />
The ILIFE V5s Pro Robot Vacuum Mop Cleaner with Water Tank is a vacuum/mop robot, so you can have all the best features.
It allows you to vacuum, sweep, damp, and mop all in one. It works on pet hair as well.
It can clean your home when you are sleeping or at work. It will dock and recharge automatically as well. It adjusts to all floor types, such as hardwood, tile, and laminate (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X1F3HXG/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">see more information here at Amazon</a>).</p>
Final tip: keeping a house clean is much easier than cleaning it after it got dirty. That's why a <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/the-house-that-cleans-itself-the-power-of-a-weekly-cleaning-schedule-198949">cleaning calendar</a> can be your most powerful ally in keeping clean floors. Once you get used to the calendar, you can clean everything just good enough. However, by keeping everything always clean, you can spare yourself the trouble of having to be too thorough because - guess what, your home is always clean anyways.

Avoiding perfectionism is also a great tip. You don't have to have floors you can eat out of, cleaner than your plates. As long as you clean everything weekly, the excess dust and bacteria will already be removed from your home and you will already have a great place to live in. Keep in mind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">80/20 principle</a>, where you get 80% of your tasks done with only 20% of your effort. Keep yourself sane by avoiding going OCD on all the nitty-gritty cleaning details, and nooks, and niches.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>B12 Vitamin (Cobalamin) Benefits</title>
		<link>http://bestlife52.com/?p=446</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 28 Jun 2018 16:40:05 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-451" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/B12-Vitamin-Benefits.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="200" />I believe that <strong>we can cure ourselves naturally</strong> in most cases by eating and exercising properly. I exercise this concept on a day-to-day basis.

And having a very curious mind, I am constantly researching the best way to work out and have tasty omnivorous nutritious meals - yes, sir! I am a foodie and <strong>I eat red meat</strong>.

Because I do my best to keep a well-balanced diet, I always want to check the facts, so I read a Harvard paper of becoming a vegetarian and I learned that B12 deficiency is an important concern about all this matter.
<h2>What do you eat?</h2>
The first issue is about having a <strong>very well balanced diet</strong>.

All main B12 food sources are linked to proteins - meat, eggs, fish, and dairy. It is separated from the protein during digestion, using a substance called intrinsic factor that is present in the stomach acid, for availability for absorption through the bloodstream.

Older adults have more susceptibility to a B12 deficiency that may impact from DNA synthesis to neurological function - and even a higher risk for children, pregnant women, vegetarians as well.

By the way, <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/becoming-a-vegetarian">if you aren’t so educated to being vegetarian</a>, you might be jeopardizing your health. And going deep into it, if you are vegan (which means that in your diet you excluded all ingredients from animal source), you will increase your risk even more.

Here are the hard numbers: today in the United States between <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/313919.php">1.5 and 15 percent of the total population</a> is currently diagnosed with a B12 deficiency.
<h2>What does the B12 do?</h2>
For better understanding, you use this important largest water-soluble B12 for body energy production, DNA synthesis, red blood cell formation (your body produces millions of red blood cells every minute!) and nerve cell health and, therefore, neurological function.

If you are over the age 65, by aging, you may decrease the stomach acid production, which affects directly B12 absorption.

Certain bacteria that uses B12 can grow better in this lower levels of stomach acid, shorten even more the B12 vitamin availability.

Rush University Medical Center (Chicago – USA), supported by a British trial, found after a 4.5-year study that the elderly with low blood B12 vitamin levels have a higher risk of losing cognitive skills and brain shrinkage - sources <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/235018.php">here</a> and <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/120899.php">here</a>.

The <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/205152.php">Alzheimer’s Disease risk is also reduced</a> by the B12 regular intake to decrease the risk of developing this illness.

So, beyond being very aware of your B12 intake and blood levels, you need to control your digestion process as well as to be prompt to absorb properly all your well-balanced meals.

Another behavior that increases the risk of B12 deficiency is <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/305280.php">being vegetarian or vegan</a>, by not assuming enough animal protein. Some researchers found that over half of the vegans studied were classified by being B12 deficient, versus 7% of the vegetarians and only 1 percent of the omnivores.

Other researchers found that <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/263626.php">the human body is unfit to process the plant-based B12</a>, like spirulina (blue-green algae) that contains a “fake” B12 vitamin type that can’t be properly absorbed.

Even though some researchers recommend B12 shots for adults over 50, this man-made version of this substance (aka cyanocobalamin) can produce redness or itching at the site of injection, irregular heartbeat, swelling of throat or tongue, and even sudden vision changes or slurred speech.

The B12 shot can interact with aspirin, antibiotics, metformin and oral contraceptives, among other medicine. And it is important to mention that cases of B12 allergies, being man-made substance, were registered.
<h2>B12 Deficiency Signs</h2>
A wide variety of symptoms can show that you are with B12 deficiency (even if it is slightly lower-than-normal levels of deficiency) and <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/253193.php">the signs include</a>:
<ul>
 	<li>Lethargy</li>
 	<li>Memory or understanding issues,</li>
 	<li>Fatigue</li>
 	<li>Headache</li>
 	<li>Depression</li>
 	<li>Heart palpitation</li>
 	<li>Yellow or very red swollen tongue</li>
 	<li>Vision changes</li>
 	<li>Mouth ulcers</li>
 	<li>Menstrual problems</li>
 	<li>Psychosis, mania, and dementia.</li>
</ul>
And there are some risk factors that can increase B12 deficiency:
<ul>
 	<li>Antiacids and medications for diabetes type 2</li>
 	<li>Alcohol abuse</li>
 	<li>Smoking</li>
 	<li>Aging</li>
 	<li>Thyroid disorder</li>
 	<li>Gastrointestinal disorders such as Crohn’s disease</li>
 	<li>Inflammation of the stomach (atrophic gastritis)</li>
 	<li>Being vegan or vegetarian</li>
</ul>
Another very important observation: children with B12 deficiency <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/313919.php">can develop severe and permanent neurological damages</a>. Another research found that children born to mothers B12 vitamin deficient may be at <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/316597.php">higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and other metabolic disorders</a>.
<h2>What Is The Ideal Intake?</h2>
The Office of Dietary Supplements recommends the average daily intake of the B12 vitamin is 2,4 mcg (micrograms) for men and women over 14. Pregnant and breastfeeding women require 2,6 mcg and 2,8 mcg, respectively.

A <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/219822.php">study</a> published in the American Journal of Epidemiology shows that low levels of the B12 vitamin in 11,216 pregnancies from 11 countries concluded that this deficiency is associated with a higher risk of preterm birth in 21%, independent if the country has high, middle or low average incomes.

B12 is <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318216.php">not considered to be toxic</a> in high quantities, like 1000 mcg dose.
<h2>How Can I Eat It?</h2>
All that being said, I invite you to improve your B12 intake through a beef brisket. My preparation suggestion is with <a href="http://bestlife52.com/kitchen/best-multi-use-rice-cooker/">sous vide technique</a> because it can retain all the juices, so the nutritious properties.

If you don’t know what kind of meat I am talking about, beef brisket is a non-noble red meat cut. So, you can have the best of animal protein ingredient, with a more frugal shopping.

		<title>Vitamin C Benefits</title>
		<link>http://bestlife52.com/?p=485</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-486" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Vitamin-C-Benefits.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="200" />
<blockquote>Vitamin C: weight loss helper, immunity boost and great helper for fighting against cancer and heart diseases</blockquote>
I know that I will have a very good day when I start my breakfast with a freshly-squeezed orange juice.

Orange is the <a href="https://www.pma.com/content/articles/2017/05/top-20-fruits-and-vegetables-sold-in-the-us">5th most consumed fresh fruit in the US</a>. So, it isn’t only my opinion that makes orange a good day starter.

As a matter of fact, I like the juice, but I enjoy eating the fruit as well: when I was a little girl, I remember seeing my mother peeling the fruit and cutting that long ribbon that made the orange sphere turn into a white one and after that, she took from the inside those refreshing pieces of sweet juice. It was almost magic to me!

Nowadays I eat the orange, always remembering that magical experience, but I know that it is the best way to intake the fibers with the juice and I feel even better.

On the other hand, one important flavonone named herperidin has most of its presence at the peel and in orange’s white inner pulp. If you don’t have time or patience to handily peel it, you can wash it and juice it all in your <a href="http://bestlife52.com/gift-ideas/best-gift-for-new-parents/">masticating juicer</a>. This phytonutrient has anti-inflammatory properties and, for that, actuated directly with cancer prevention.

And if you are about to go shopping, it is important to know that there are 2 general types of orange: bitter and sweet. Bitter oranges mostly are used to bud another varieties, as per their endurance because they are very well prepared to survive in a hostile environment (bugs, bacteria and weather changes, among others). In <a href="http://bestlife52.com/kitchen/">cooking</a>, you can use bitter oranges to make marmalades or liquors. I already did both and the bitter orange brings a very particular taste in these receipts, something unusual and a little bit wild, in my opinion.

The other general type, the sweet oranges, are the ones we juice or eat. They are divided in other 2 categories:
<ul>
 	<li>The first ones (Jaffa, Navel and Valencia, among others) have its pulp colored yellow and are extensively planted and more commercialized.</li>
 	<li>The second one are called blood oranges, little bit smaller, having its fragrance more aromatic and its flesh is red. Moro and Tarocco, both native to Italy, and Sanguinello, Spanish variety, are the main varieties.</li>
</ul>
It is important to know that also pigmented varieties like Cara Cara Navels and Vaniglia Sanguignos have lycopene giving its red color, contrary to the “true” blood oranges, that have anthocyanins.

These anthocyanins are a water-soluble pigment and has potential as per its <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2017/1672567/">free-radical scavenging actuate as antibacterial and antioxidant</a>.

So, if you are looking for the unique blood orange healthy benefits, choose Moro, the “deep blood orange”, the most colorful between the blood oranges and after that, we suggest you prefer the Sanguinello and Tarocco. The latter is also called as “half-blood”.

Obviously, organic fruits are always my first choice.

Going back to the health effects, I can tell you that I have weight concerns - I am also starting menopause. Like almost everyone I know, I have to watch my diet in order to not gain weight. But it isn’t only a matter of fashion concern, seeing that overweight and obesity is the major health issue worldwide, considered like epidemic.

I believe that some part of this “overweight fever” is all about marketing and the manufacturers and laboratories needs that they are trying to sell something that you don’t need, but obesity is a fact and it is a trigger to a wide variety of illness or health related issues, like type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis, liver disease, sleep apnea and depression, among others.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_body_mass_index">Body mass index (BMI)</a> is the measure of your weight divided by the square of your height, and it helps you to know if you are overweight or obese. It is important to know that in the U.S., the National Center for Health Statistics at the CDC states (2015-2016) that 39.7% of men and 41.1% of women were obese (20 years old and older), which means 70 million adults are obese (35 million men and 35 million women) and 79 million are overweight (45 million men and 34 million women).

And there are other implication as of 2014, approximately 1/3 of children and teenagers in U.S. are overweight or obese and about 80% will become overweight adults.

Obesity contributes to approximately up to 400 000 deaths/year in U.S. So, being overweight or obese have direct impact on quality’s health and life expectancy.

And if you struggle with overweight or obesity, certainly you already learn about <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/metabolic-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20351916">metabolic syndrome</a>.

As per Mayo Clinic, overweight and obesity is narrowly linked with metabolic syndrome and vice-versa.

And it has its cause also with insulin resistance, which is that you aren’t properly breaking down foods into glucose (sugar). The insulin, which is secreted by your pancreas controls this metabolism phase and the result of it is that you have a slow metabolism = what you eat is heavily processed by your body.

And insulin resistance may be an start to type II diabetes.

In fact, the overweight and obesity cause are strongly connected to your metabolism, which is what you eat and how much and how you work out.

And, for me, one of the best way to stay the on the health weight is to eat wealthier. And for help us on that, there is the <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09637486.2015.1093610">blood orange</a>. The lipid-lowering properties of the blood orange juice showed that it may prevents the development of the metabolic syndrome, however, this study in particular doesn’t demonstrate that this juice can lower body weight.

However, <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14786419.2014.1000897?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true">this study</a> attests that the Moro juice extract can display anti-obesity effects in vitro and in vivo as well.

<a href="https://scholar.google.it/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=Red+Orange%3A+Experimental+Models+and+Epidemiological+Evidence+of+Its+Benefits+on+Human+Health&amp;btnG">Another scientific study</a> affirms that the phytochemicals has the capability to interact with biomembranes.

And, comparing the processed juice with the fresh squeezed one, the results revealed that the antioxidant activity is directly related to the amount of anthocyanins. Once the amount of the anthocyanins is reduced on the long-shelf life juices, so it is its impact on the antioxidant power.

Some other very important matter is related with the intake of vitamin C supplement. As per one experimental study, the protection against oxidative DNA damage promoted by the fresh squeezed blood orange juice is better than if you take only the equal amount of vitamin via supplement. The scientists explain it once the other phytochemicals contained in blood orange of the juice being responsible for the human bioavailability and, therefore, its healthy impact.

<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14786419.2014.1000897?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true">This particular study</a> also says that its mice tests results that fresh blood orange juice (especially Moro juice) has been found to limit weight gain, increase insulin sensitivity, decrease triglycerides and total cholesterol.

So, bottom line, as I mentioned before, the juice is far better than the supplement, and eating the orange (with the inner pulp) is even better. And, if you have a masticating juicer, it is the best option, once you can take advantage of the peel nutrients as well.

I wish you a healthy day, at you next blood orange juice!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Great Flavor For Great Value: Tiger JAX-T18U-K 10-cup Rice Cooker Review</title>
		<link>http://bestlife52.com/?p=536</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 05 Mar 2018 05:37:59 +0000</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[Diogo]]></dc:creator>
		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://bestlife52.com/?p=536</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="box"><img class="size-medium wp-image-177 alignright" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Best-Rice-Cooker-Tiger-JAX-T10U-K-on-countertop-300x229.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="229" />This Tiger JAX-T18U-K 10-cup rice cooker is <strong>very well suited for people who are demanding about their rice and also want that extra capacity to steam vegetables and seafood at the same time</strong>, thanks to its Tacook secondary heating tray.
It does cost more than other cheap rice cookers in the market, which might even come with more bells and whistles, however <strong>the main purpose of this appliance is focused in cooking very good rice every single time</strong>. It has several menus dedicated to different types of rice, which ensure enough variety of rice types and flavors.
This is the <strong>ideal rice cooker for two types of people</strong>, either 1-) Asian families, who eat rice daily and know exactly what well prepared, quality rice tastes like, or 2-) demanding and busy home foodies, who want to take their rice quality to the next level, while freeing up rice prep time to other activities in the kitchen and ensuring consistent and tasty results every single time.
If rice has any importance in your life, like it has in mine, <strong>go for this thing and you will enjoy every single dollar of value</strong> – and more – for many years to come. In all my life having quality rice cookers made by Zojirushi and Tiger, I have never had one break down on me. If I had to buy a new machine, it was always due to changing homes (and countries) or simply due to wishing to update the technology and get a newer one.
<strong>The major downside of buying this rice cooker is that you will never be able to return to $30 appliances again, because the taste difference is significant.</strong>
If you feel the price of this unit is a bit on the high side (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">click here to see current price on Amazon now</a>), that is because you never knew rice could taste so good.</p>

<h2>Uses</h2>
There are <strong>two preset options for preparing white rice: Plain and Quick</strong>. The Quick function prepares one cup of rice in 20 or so minutes, which is enough for two people. If you prefer fluffier rice, you will be better off using the Plain option and the flavor will be much better.

This Tiger also has a <strong>dedicated brown rice mode</strong>, which allows for longer water absorption and yields much better results. You can also use the Plain setting for germinated brown rice, whole rice, and semi-polished rice.

You can also choose between <strong>Hard and Soft types of Porridge</strong>.

The <strong>Slow Cook mode</strong> allows for up to 3 hours of cooking for all your favorite recipes.

The <strong>Synchro-Cooking preset</strong> allows you to <strong>cook rice in the inner pot and another dish in the Tacook cooking plate</strong>.

This is why <strong>I recommend you buy the bigger 10-cup version of this rice cooker</strong> instead of the 5.5-cup capacity.

The smaller rice cooker is good for making only rice, as well as the Synchro-Cooking along with the Tacook plate for up to 2 people, but making bigger portions for more people (and, therefore, using the cooker more often) will necessarily mean you need the extra capacity.

<strong>Mixed/Sweet and Multigrain menus</strong> allow you to cook grains other than rice – such as quinoa, lentils, beans, barley, farro, and so on.

And, last, the <strong>Steam function</strong> allows you to steam meats and veggies. By avoiding the use of excess oils you will ensure a healthier meal.

This rice cooker also has <strong>two timers, so you can preset the time in which you want your dish to be completed</strong>. You preload all the ingredients and the Tiger starts cooking in order to complete it at the time you chose. The two timers can be set independently – say Timer 1 for breakfast and Timer 2 for dinner – up to 24 hours in advance.

Once the cooking is done, the cooker will beep three times and the automatic <strong>Keep Warm</strong> feature kicks in, keeping your food at the ideal temperature for up to 12 hours.
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><strong><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-187" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Best-Rice-Cooker-Tiger-JAX-T10U-K-steaming-basket-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" />Tacook Synchro-Cooking</strong>. It is a secondary cooking plate that allows you</li>
 	<li> to prepare a main dish while you also cook your rice – in other words, “one-pot meals”. It saves you time in the kitchen and ensures your family can still eat healthy, homemade meals. You can also save money by ordering less takeout meals.</li>
 	<li><strong>Micom Technology</strong>. It makes multiple automatic adjustments during cooking to ensure the rice is cooked evenly, as well as that its moisture is ideal and uniform.</li>
 	<li><strong>Quality inner pot</strong>. It is removable, made of aluminum, and has a non-stick coating. Plus, there are inner water level markings for both white and brown rice, so you can measure water accurately</li>
 	<li><strong>Easy to wash</strong>. You can remove the inner lid, the steam cap, and the inner pot for cleaning all parts without hassle.</li>
 	<li><strong>Countdown display</strong>. Starting 12 minutes before the end of the cooking, the cooker will show a timer indicating the rice will be done. It does not start from the beginning because rice cooking is not determined by time – instead, it is determined by the time it takes for the rice to absorb the water. This is not a timed procedure, which is why it is so hard to cook rice in a stove.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Additional Features</h2>
<strong>Easy to use</strong>. Although it comes with a thick instructions manual and a cookbook with hard-to-source Asian ingredients, this rice cooker is very simple to operate and figure out.
<h2>Performance</h2>
Using the Tiger JAX-T18U-K is very straightforward. Here are the literal steps:
<ol>
 	<li>Grab the rice cooker bowl and place the amount of rice you want to cook.</li>
 	<li>Get rid of excess starch by rinsing the rice 2-3 times: add water, swish and drain it, and repeat the process.</li>
 	<li>Add water to the marking on the bowl.</li>
 	<li>Place the bowl back in the rice cooker, select the corresponding cooking mode for your rice variety, and hit start.</li>
</ol>
Once the cooking is done (around 30 minutes for white rice on Plain mode), the cooker will beep three times and change cooking modes into Keep Warm.
<h2>Unboxing</h2>
<img class="size-medium wp-image-183 alignright" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Best-Rice-Cooker-Tiger-JAX-T18U-K-box-300x256.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="256" />Open the box and you will find:
<ul>
 	<li>the rice cooker itself, which is made of plastic and stainless steel,</li>
 	<li>the non-stick coated, aluminum inner pan,</li>
 	<li>an instructions manual,</li>
 	<li>a cookbook,</li>
 	<li>the rice measuring cup,</li>
 	<li>a rice paddle/spatula and ladle/holder, and</li>
 	<li>the BPA-free Tacook cooking plate.</li>
</ul>
There is a notch at the side where you fit the included holder, so you can place the included rice spatula there.
<h2>Dimensions</h2>
The rice cooker measures 14.6 x 11.1 x 9.8 in (37 x 28 x 24.8 cm) and weights 9.04 lbs (4.1 kg). Total shipping weight is 10.95 lbs (4.96 kg). It is easy to move around the counter as needed.

Power cord length is 3 ft (91 cm), enough so you can place it further away from the power outlet if you have space restrictions.

The cooker depth is 15 in (38 cm) and height is 16 in (40.6 cm), so you should be able to use normally fully open on your counter – even under a kitchen cabinet.
<h2>Pros</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Made in Japan</strong>. Japanese rice cooker makers usually have two quality standards – one product line made in Japan, which are usually more expensive and have more features, and a secondary product line made in China, with simpler products.</li>
 	<li><strong>Flavor</strong>. If you are a person who really likes rice, you will enjoy much tastier rice. Instead, if you don’t see this as importantly, then you are better off buying a cheap rice cooker and keeping the price difference in your pocket.</li>
 	<li><strong>Stainless steel</strong>. It looks great in any kitchen counter.</li>
 	<li><strong>One-pot meals</strong>. Buy the bigger version and you will be able to cook side dishes on the Tacook cooking plate for extra convenience.</li>
 	<li><strong>Variety</strong>. You can use this rice cooker for a variety of rice and grains.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Non-retractable power cord</strong>. I have owned two rice cookers that auto coiling cord and one that didn’t. The main advantage, for me, is to have easy storage for the power cord and clean the counter, clean the rice cooker itself, store it in a cabinet, and so on.</li>
 	<li><strong>No condensation collector</strong>. In my experience, good rice cookers bring a condensation collector. This way the water that condenses at the lid has somewhere to accumulate once you open the lid and the residual water drips. You can solve most of that by allowing your rice to sit for a few extra minutes at the Keep Warm function.</li>
 	<li><strong>Hatch door swings open too hard, plus</strong> (<em>somewhat</em>) <strong>slippery feet</strong>. You can avoid both issues by holding the hatch door when you press the lever and adding some rubber feet, and both items do not affect the quality of the rice prepared by this appliance, however it is a detail that drew my attention and I wanted to mention it nonetheless.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cost-Benefit Ratio</h2>
Cooks superb rice, easy to use, even easier to clean, high quality, and made in Japan. I strongly recommend this Tiger unit.
<p class="box"><img class="alignright wp-image-182 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Best-Rice-Cooker-Tiger-JAX-T18U-K-rice-and-steaming-basket-209x300.jpg" alt="" width="209" height="300" />This is the <strong>perfect rice cooker to last you many years to come</strong>. Easy to use and clean, built to high quality standards, perfect for anyone who likes tasty, fluffy rice base dishes, great size for small to average families, looks very sleek in any kitchen counter, lightweight to move it in and out of the pantry.
<strong>You can even cook bigger portions and have leftovers for lunches</strong> – which is why I recommend the bigger 10-cup version of this rice cooker, since you might as well get more meals for your efforts, right?
<strong>This is also a great wedding gift as well.</strong>

		<title>Rice Cooker Lithium Batteries: All You Need To Know</title>
		<link>http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/rice-cooker-li-battery-replacement/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If your rice cooker has a timer function, chances are it will have an internal lithium battery to remember the time.

If it didn't, then you would have to manually reset the time each and every time you unplugged your rice cooker - as in most annoying microwaves that simply blink 12:00. In other words, this battery affects both the time shown and the timer function, because the timer works based on the rice cooker clock.

<strong>This lithium battery inside the rice cooker is soldered on a circuit board</strong>.

Lifespan of this battery lasts anywhere between 4 and 7 years. If you have some soldering knowledge, you might be able to replace it yourself. (Bear in mind you will void the warranty if you choose this route. You could also damage your rice cooker.) Otherwise you will be stuck with the official repair centers for changing these batteries. Cost for everything is between $6 and $15 for the battery, plus $10 to $20 for the labor.

<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: The rice cooker itself works perfectly without the battery. The only dead battery issue is having to reset the time manually if and when you want to use the timer function. I have seen my family using rice cookers since I was 9 (I am currently 35 as I write this) and neither them nor I have ever used the timer function. It is probably our lifestyle.

You could also leave your unit always plugged in. That helps to increase battery life because the clock function power will be provided by your home. On the other hand, then you will probably want a surge protector to avoid a bigger expense.

You can find below two examples of how this work could be done if you are curious and patient. The first uses no solder:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cxC9gGFJL_A?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="448" height="252" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

The second uses solder and even offers a way to replace the battery in the future:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WuGIEnwyau8?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="448" height="252" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

In short, this lithium battery came to be in first place so people wouldn't have to adjust the time after unplugging their rice cookers. Once it dies, it is not a big deal for most folks.

If you do need the timer function and want to replace the battery, the only cost for the DIY route is the battery itself ($2-3 at most) or $16-35 if you have it done in an official repair center.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Best-est Rice Cooker EVAH: Zojirushi NP-NVC10</title>
		<link>http://bestlife52.com/?p=541</link>
		<pubDate>Fri, 09 Mar 2018 11:51:26 +0000</pubDate>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="box"><img class="wp-image-543 size-medium alignleft" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Zojirushi-NP-NVC10-250x149.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="149" />If you want the <strong>best rice flavor</strong> and you are in the market for a <strong>top-notch rice cooker</strong> and <strong>money is not an issue</strong>, then you found your <strong>perfect match</strong>. This Zojirushi makes use of all the best technology available today to deliver <strong>tasty and soft rice (without mushiness) each and every time</strong>. You get much more than your dollars’ worth, although it is a bit pricey – <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009QYC60S?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">click here to see current prices on Amazon</a> or keep on reading below for my Zojirushi NP-NVC10 review.</p>

<h2>Uses</h2>
This Zojirushi will make you all types of delicious rice you can imagine. Other than the most obvious type, white rice, it also has dedicated menus for:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Brown rice</strong>. Here it adds preheating time, which increases water absorption, and uses lower cooking temperatures as well, increasing cooking time and transforming hardness into bran rice – without mushiness.<img class="alignleft wp-image-551 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Zojirushi-NP-NVC10-Pressure-Settings-250x172.png" alt="" width="250" height="172" /></li>
 	<li><strong>Sushi rice</strong>. The main difference here from simple white rice is that sushi rice gets handled once it is cooked, using less water on the cooking process. It is slightly firmer.</li>
 	<li><strong>Mixed rice</strong>. This is rice cooked with seasonings or extra ingredients. The cooking temperatures are lower, so the ingredients do not boil over.</li>
 	<li><strong>Porridge</strong>. This rice cooker prepares fluffier porridge by allowing lower cooking temperatures and longer cooking times, resulting in softer texture.<img class="alignleft wp-image-546 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Zojirushi-NP-NVC10-GABA-Brown-Rice-Setting-250x155.png" alt="" width="250" height="155" /></li>
 	<li><strong>GABA Brown Rice</strong>. This menu setting allows for increased levels of gamma/aminobutyric acid (GABA). This is an amino acid believed to help lower blood pressure, improve kidney function, and reduce stress levels. This function works by soaking brown rice at 104 °F (40 °C) during 2 hours before the starting the cooking process.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>AI Fuzzy Logic Technology</strong>. This uses <em>artificial intelligence</em> to accumulate previous cooking experiences and improve the cooking results each time. Even if the season changes, and water and room temperatures change as well, the rice results are always consistent. This also allows your unit to remember the rice amounts you use most often and select the best cooking flow via a special <em>microchip</em> – which computes cooking temperature and duration, regulates your raw grain pre-soaking time, and even the amount of time for the final steaming period before serving you the <strong><em>best rice possible</em></strong>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Induction Heating</strong>. IH distributes the heat more evenly throughout the cooking pan, so <em>the final result is both precise and uniform</em>.<img class="alignleft wp-image-547 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Zojirushi-NP-NVC10-Induction-Heating-250x166.png" alt="" width="250" height="166" /></li>
 	<li><strong>IH Pressure System</strong>. This allows the unit to cook rice at higher temperatures than 212 °F (100 °C), and the final result is <em>rice that remains soft for longer periods of time</em>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Platinum-Infused, Non-Stick Inner Cooking Pan</strong>. The platinum particles infused in the nonstick coating alkalize water. This water breaks the surface protein in the rice grain, so water penetrates the grain easier. As a result, your <em>rice flavor is enhanced</em>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Umami Setting</strong>. The Japanese consider it a 5th flavor, adding to salty, sweet, bitter, and sour. Its name comes from the Japanese word for “deliciousness” or “good flavor”. This setting soaks rice for a longer period, so the sugar contained within the grain is gradually released into the cooking water. This sugar will then stick to the rice grain surface once the cooking begins, and the rice will taste sweeter. The steaming time at the end of the cooking process is also extended for <em>improved flavor</em>.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-553" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Zojirushi-NP-NVC10-Umami-Setting.png" alt="" width="659" height="156" /></li>
</ul>
<h2>Additional Features</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Steam-Reduce Setting</strong>. The steaming time is reduced by 50% for <em>slightly firmer rice texture</em>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Scorched Setting</strong>. It toasts the bottom of the pot for a <em>crispier texture and immediate consumption</em>.<img class="alignleft wp-image-552 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Zojirushi-NP-NVC10-Scorch-Setting-250x150.png" alt="" width="250" height="150" /></li>
 	<li><strong>Extended Keep Warm</strong>. It will use a lower temperature setting for <em>allowing a longer keep warm period of time</em>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Reheat Function</strong>. In <em>only 5-8 minutes</em>, it will increase the rice temperature <em>as if you were just finished cooking</em> after you used the Keep Warm or Extended Keep Warm settings.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Performance</h2>
You can cook white rice using the quick setting in 33-36 minutes, depending on the water and the room temperature. The regular setting is 54-57 minutes, and umami setting is 74 minutes.

The results are always spectacular, fluffy, and very consistent. This model is especially good for cooking brown rice – which is a harder feat.

The inner coating is high quality and it is very easy to clean, which leads to using it more often and eating rice more often.

<img class="alignright wp-image-83 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Rice-Cooker-Zojirushi-NP-NVC10-front-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />The smaller version (1.0 liter) cooks anywhere from 1 to 5.5 Japanese cups of uncooked rice, and the bigger version (1.8 liters) cooks between 3 and 10 cups of rice. That means 11 rice bowls for the 5.5-cup rice cooker, more than enough for 2 people plus guests.

If eating white rice, my usual measurement is 2/3 of a cup of uncooked rice per person. Fried rice means 1 cup per person.

Personally, I prefer the smaller size (5.5-cup/1 liter) than the bigger one (10-cup/1.8 liter) since I do not plan on receiving too many people at once in my home and I can't justify the extra money it costs plus the extra space it occupies while I will rarely, if ever, use its main benefit - the increased capacity.
<h2>Unboxing</h2>
The box that arrives at your house weights 14.6 lbs (6.6 kg). The unit itself weights 13 lbs (5.8 kg).

Open the box and you will find the Zojirushi NP-NVC10, the warranty and user manual booklets, the spatula and its holder, and two measuring cups – one for rice, another for rinse-free rice.
<h2>Dimensions</h2>
This rice cooker measures 10.1 in (25.6 cm) wide x 15.4 in (39.1 cm) deep x 8.6 in (21.8 cm) high. It is not too cumbersome or heavy.

The standard cabinet size is 24 in (61 cm) deep, so you still have 8-ish inches (20-ish centimeters) between you and this unit, which is enough to accommodate small rice bowls for servings, spoons, and most practical needs during and after cooking.
<h2>Pros</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Taste</strong>. It is hard to imagine rice can taste better than this. Here is a good case where you get your money’s worth.</li>
 	<li><strong>Made in Japan</strong>. Japanese rice cooker brands usually have two lineups: the ones made in China are cheaper and sold at a lower price range, and the ones made in Japan and able to use the finest technology that delivers the best flavor each and every time.</li>
 	<li><strong>Better Bowl Design</strong>. The NP-NVC10 is capable is cooking tastier rice and deliver more uniform results partially due to improvements achieved in design by the Zojirushi engineers.</li>
 	<li><img class="alignright wp-image-545 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Zojirushi-NP-NVC10-Cleaning-250x218.png" alt="" width="250" height="218" /><img class="alignright wp-image-554 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Zojirushi-NP-NVC10-Cleaning-2-250x223.png" alt="" width="250" height="223" /><strong>Easy To Clean</strong>. I strongly believe in appliances that are easy to wash get to be used very often. When cleaning becomes a chore, appliances get boxed and forgotten. The detachable inner lid allows you to quickly wash it under the sink and wipe clean the inside of your rice cooker.</li>
 	<li><strong>Easy-To-Read LCD Screen</strong>. This is especially important if you intend to use the clock and timer features.<img class="alignleft wp-image-544 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Zojirushi-NP-NVC10-Artificial-Intelligence-250x149.png" alt="" width="250" height="149" /></li>
</ul>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>One-Trick Pony</strong>. You are not supposed to cook steel cut oats, bake cakes, steam food or use it as a slow cooker or prepare anything non-rice really. Since this is a pressure rice cooker, Zojirushi says doing so may clog up vent and filters on this model’s inner lid – its grains are smaller than rice’s.
<ul>
 	<li>Some users on Amazon have reported cooking steel cut oatmeal by pre-soaking it, using the porridge setting, and cooking smaller amounts of grain each time. They have not reported any issues doing so.</li>
 	<li>My take? Officially, you may damage your high-end rice cooker and void the warranty by using it in this way, so it is your call on how to proceed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Daily Use Of A Pressure Cooker</strong>. Due to the extra safety and sealing needed to operate a pressure cooker, simple lid operations such as opening and closing it once you cooked something gets more difficult after the rice cooker has been off for a while. Pressing the upper button does not always release the lid instantly due to the pressure. Closing the lid demands a little more patience than normal rice cookers. All that while not forcing anything open or close. It is that tiny extra patience you need in exchange for the flavor in each and every meal.</li>
 	<li><strong>24-Hour Clock Only</strong>. Here it is me nitpicking. Users are stuck with military time for using the timer, which is probably to avoid confusion between programming the timer for 06:00 for the breakfast or 18:00 for dinner. However, how hard could it be to allow the extra space for a little AM and another tiny PM by the clock?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cost-Benefit Ratio</h2>
Answering this will strongly depend on what your uses and expectations are. (Duh!)<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-548" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Zojirushi-NP-NVC10-Keep-Warm-Monitor.png" alt="" width="657" height="309" />

I can see this unit working really well for Asian families, people who lived in Asia for a while, people who like brown rice but dislike its hardness, and simply people who like rice.

On the other hand, if you simply want rice and don’t care all that much about it, you are probably better off with a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/kitchen/big-slow-cooker-cheap-rice-cooker/">cheaper rice cooker</a> or even a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/kitchen/geekchef-review/">cheap pressure cooker</a> and using the money for something else you value.
<p class="box">If you like brown rice, then you will be using a lot of the GABA Brown Rice preset mode that pre-soaks rice for longer and uses pressure to cook rice at a higher temperature, resulting in brown rice as soft as white rice. <strong>This is the best Zojirushi rice cooker currently for sale outside of Japan</strong> – meaning it has menus in English and no need for electrical transformers. The NP-NVC10 is as good as rice can get for the moment.

		<title>Best Shaver For Travelers - Philips Norelco 8900 S8950/90 Review</title>

I got that, plus <strong>smoothest shaves I have ever had</strong>. If you travel often like I do, you will also enjoy the <strong>travel case</strong>, the <strong>battery duration</strong> (I have used this shaver 10 days and the battery was still running great), and the <strong>travel lock feature</strong>, which is well thought and super simple to use.
This thing is a steal because of the <strong>self-cleaning and charging station</strong>, which means you are <strong>always ready to pack up and hit the road</strong>. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012VL5TB0?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Click here to see today's prices at Amazon</a> or keep on reading my experience below.</p>

<h2>Philips Norelco 8900 S8950/90 Review</h2>
I had been using a Philips HQ6070 for almost 10 years before I decided it was time to change it. It was a great unit and its battery was still going strong – this for me was the best aspect because I am a frequently traveler and having the possibility to leave the charger behind has always been a huge benefit.

When I first chose the HQ6070, I searched for the cheapest shaver with the cheapest replacement heads I could find. This time around, however, I wanted a self-cleaning device. Cleaning and maintaining my electric razor has always been the most time-consuming task. So I decided to find a cheap Philips self-cleaning electric shaver, because of my past positive experiences.

Enters the Philips Norelco 8900 S8950/90. It has 3 shaving heads, instead of the 2 my old unit had, and what a difference it makes. I only do dry shaves and I can get a great shave on all the different parts of my face, jawline, upper lip, and neck.

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-620" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Philips-Norelco-8900-S8950-90-in-use-dry-250x169.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="169" />Philips says it can take up to 21 days for the best shaving results, but my face already acclimated with the S8950 on my first shave. I don’t even do the recommended circular motion for shaving – past habit inherited from my previous Braun foil shaver – and I already reap all the benefits from this wonderful machine. So far I have had no issues with hair pulling or skin sensitivity.

You can clean and maintain the 8900 series by simply popping the heads, rinsing them, and air drying them. Every so often – I usually do it once a week on my old unit – you also should remove the ring and the circular heads to individually clean them as well.

Cleaning it manually is super easy, and it is the exact process I wanted to avoid.

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-623" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Philips-Norelco-8900-S8950-90-smart-clean-250x134.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="134" />Although the cleaning/docking system is large – which means more bathroom counter “real estate” needed, I am now in a place in my life where I have very little spare time and I would rather free up time for family and hobbies than spend it cleaning my razor circular heads.

Plus, the cleaning solution also lubricates the blades, thus increasing their lifespan.

I also don’t worry about having to buy cleaning refills, because it is easy to DIY them – and while I gladly pay for the extra convenience, I am also frugal enough to save money on this front.

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-613" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Philips-Norelco-8900-S8950-90-battery-level-indicator-travel-lock-250x134.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="134" />While using the Philips, it feels substantial and solid in my hands. There is a 3-light indicator and I have been away from home during a 10-day trip and I had no problem with the battery.

And you can use a simple Travel Lock mode by holding the power button during 3 seconds to activate or deactivate the lock, which stops the shaver from turning on by itself in your bag.

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-624" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Philips-Norelco-8900-S8950-90-travel-case-250x134.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="134" />The travel case is good, protects its contents, and is firm enough.

The trimmer attachment has good quality. I used to have a pop-out trimmer in my old Philips, but this one is more powerful. It also has an adjustable comb with a built-in slider, and this slider is removable too.

This guy also has a display indicator for the heads replacement, which is a nice extra. It is sure easy enough to know when your shavings are not as close as they used to be, however I welcome the extra layer of attention Philips put in this product. (Plus, it is in their best interest to sell new replacement heads as often as possible.)
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Close shaves</strong>. Philips has fancy names such as Contour Detect Technology, where each head pivots great, and are super flexible to reach all the angles and curves in your face, V-Track Precision Blades, which pick the optimal cutting position for your face hair, plus self-sharpening blades, which ensure best results every day. In every day terms, this S8950/90 gives you premium shaves for average money.</li>
 	<li><strong>SmartClean system</strong>. If you don’t bother cleaning your shaver under the tap, do yourself a favor and save money by choosing a cheaper model. Personally, I chose this one specifically for the simplified maintenance provided by this system. I press a button and my shaver gets cleaned and lubricated. The stand also keeps the battery charged at all times, which is very practical too if you are like me and travel often.</li>
 	<li><strong><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-616" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Philips-Norelco-8900-S8950-90-click-on-beard-styler-250x134.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="134" />Quality trimmer</strong>. You can style your beard in 5 built-in lengths – from stubble to a short beard. Tips and comb were thought out to avoid irritating your skin, which reflects how much engineering goes behind this product.</li>
 	<li><strong>LED display</strong>. This is where you see battery level, Travel Lock on, and whether or not you need replacement shaving heads.</li>
 	<li><strong>Made in the Netherlands</strong>. With so much stuff made using cheap labor these days, it is nice to know some manufacturers still care about building quality over bottom low prices.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Performance</h2>
Performance for me has been top-notch from the first day, even though Philips says it can take up to 21 days for optimal results. This unit has been as good from the start, just as my old Philips shaver.
<h2>Unboxing</h2>
<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-612" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Philips-Norelco-8900-S8950-90-250x220.png" alt="" width="250" height="220" />Open the box and you will find the instructions manual, the shaver itself with its cleaning and charging station, the beard attachments, and the travel case.
<h2>Dimensions</h2>
Shipping weight is 3.3 lbs (1.5 kg), and the shaver plus the station weigh 3.22 lbs (1.4 kg). Total dimensions are 8 x 11.1 x 5.7 in (203 x 281 x 144 mm).
<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
To be honest, I don't have many words left here. This unit offers all the main benefits I wished for, however it isn't exactly cheap. I am pretty sure I am getting my money's worth, which is why I ended up buying it.
<h2>Cost-Benefit Ratio</h2>
<p class="box"><img class="alignleft wp-image-626 size-medium" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Philips-Norelco-8900-S8950-90-wet-shave-e1524032664161-250x184.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="184" />I was searching for a cheap electric shaver with self-cleaning function. Not only this Philips Norelco delivers it, it is also the closest and smoothest shaves I have ever had.
I have been away from home for 10 days and I had no issues with the battery – the travel lock is simple to use and very convenient as well.
The trimmer head is powerful and has an adjustable guard. I only dry shave, but this unit allows for wet shaving as well.

		<title>Warning: are Benchtop Jointers worth it? How can I use them?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I do woodworking as a hobby and I want to take it up a notch. I recently decided my next tool purchase will be a jointer. My main issue is dealing with a very small shop, so I want something compact.

<strong>A benchtop jointer is great for beginner or hobbist woodworkers or even professionals in smaller shops. If your woodworking consists of smaller-to-medium items, you can rely on 6- or 8-inch jointers to accurately true smaller or shorter stock, say up to 4 feet or so. Benchtop jointers are also faster than hand planing and much simpler than constantly setting up multiple jigs to start processing your rough lumber on your router table or table saw. They are also cheaper than buying S4S lumber (all faces and edges smooth), and give you more flexibility in species, lumber dimensions, and even wood figure. Keep on reading as I expand all of these arguments in my article.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-891" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Cutech-40180H-CT-banner.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="222" />
<h2>Is the investment in a Benchtop Jointer worth it?</h2>
Convenience sure is expensive. This is what you trade when you choose to build using home center S4S instead of milling your own wood at home.

Wood magazine did an interesting math using a branket chest project a few years ago. Given that S4S wood costs between 50% and 100% more when compared to rough sawn stock, they chose their blanket chest project and a few woods in order to determine how many chests you would have to build in order to save enough money to get a "free" benchtop jointer AND a benchtop planer, both new. The math was simple and based on two shopping lists:
<ul>
 	<li>Home center
<ul>
 	<li>8 pc 1x6x72",</li>
 	<li>1 pc 1x3x48", and</li>
 	<li>4 pc 1x6x48"</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Lumberyard
<ul>
 	<li>41 board feet rough-sawn, which accounted for 25% waste during the milling process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Their results were more than clear:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>if you used red oak you only needed to build 5 chests to get your "free" machines</strong>;</li>
 	<li>using maple you needed to build 6 chests for your "freebies"; and</li>
 	<li>16 chests if you used pine.</li>
</ul>
The numbers don't lie and <strong>the savings are immense</strong>. If you do one single batch of Christmas presents for your family, you can already earn your very own "free" tools from lumber savings.

Any other savings after these are more money you can save towards new tool purchases, which will certainly contribute to increase your woodworking skills and encourage you to tackle even bigger, more complex projects.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/grizzly-powertec-shop-fox-are-the-same-01.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="222" />
<h2>Unexpected benefits</h2>
Working with rough lumber gives you so much versatility.

First of all, it allows you to use <strong>other wood species</strong>, instead of being restricted by the lumber selection available at your local home center.

Second, the home center also limits you in lumber thickness and dimensions for your panels as you see fit for your project, enabling you to achieve more proportional results.

Third, you will be able to experience and work with <strong>different wood figures and grain and incorporate those in your design</strong>. This will unlock yet another world of possibilities for your woodworking skills and projects, where <strong>the wood itself will add beauty to your work</strong>.

You can also go to different places to find cheaper/free lumber for milling, such as going to lumberyards and getting to know experienced people who can teach you more about wood, searching for rough lumber ads on eBay, and even posting ads on Craigslist for searching fallen trees that you can mill yourself.
<h2>Alternatives for owning a Benchtop Jointer</h2>
You can buy a bigger machine, you can joint boards by hand, or you can simply buy pre-surfaced boards. Two of these make you spend more money, and two of these make you spend more time.
<ol>
 	<li>Buying a bigger machine will give you extra capacity, a bigger motor, and more stability, however <strong>a stationary jointer costs you more initially</strong>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Jointing boards by hand gives you, well, nice wood shavings... Right</strong>? Jokes aside, it is a time-consuming method when you can simply use a power tool and get more accurate, much faster results. Unless you are really anti-machinery, it doesn't make much sense to rely on hand planing in place of a jointer.</li>
 	<li>Buying S4S pre-surfaced boards, in my opinion, is the worst of both worlds. Often these boards won't even be perfectly finished and parallel. Even if they are, you still need to take them from the store to your shop, and leave it there to acclimate to your shop humidity levels. Once this process is finished, it is unlikely your lumber will still be flat. In the end, you just pay more for the pre-surfaced lumber convenience, but then you need to re-surface it again and end up with thinner boards. In other words, <strong>the only warranty you have when buying S4S is that you spend more money</strong>, because chances are you will have to mill your stock at your shop because the boards will still be not perfect.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Benchtop or stationary models?</h2>
I can tell you very clearly from the start: stationary jointers have bulkier build quality and have motors that work at lower speeds. And <strong>they are much, much pricier</strong>. Not to mention they need more floor space as well, which is always a rare commodity if you have a small shop or you simply like to park your car inside your garage.

I think it's quite pedantic to say that any and all benchtop jointers are useless and that only stationary jointers are worth your money. That is just like saying that used economy cars are all trash and the only good cars worth buying are brand-new Audis.

Sure, I would also love to live in the best of the worlds, but sometimes life just doesn't work like that. Life is a journey, where we can make gradual improvements over time.

I don't think it's wise to go into debt for buying a more powerful machine - my ego does not rely on my tool brands, or car brands, or any other brand for that matter. Spending too much money on power tools surely helps, but is not a warranty that my woodworking quality will suddenly improve.

You can also save more money before finally buying a better-quality jointer, but why should you wait that long?

Meanwhile, you can get a basic model and get access to a wider variety of wood species and lumber dimensions. Why should you spend more money for a limited assortment of wood species and dimensions?

You can buy right now a cheap benchtop jointer and start working with exotic woods and make beautiful projects.
<h2>Final Considerations</h2>
This will sound stupid, but with all being said, there is no best answer between hand planing, table saw and router jigs, benchtop jointer, and a stationary jointer. It depends a lot on personal factors such as space availability, money you can spend, your style of <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/new-hobby-woodworking/">woodworking</a>, the time you can dedicate to it, the types of projects you build, and so on.

In my case, I decided for a benchtop model because I have limited time in the shop - and I want to make the best use of it, limited space, and I simply want to make some exotic dust in my spare time, instead of making a living by selling period, handcrafted furniture. I also tend to do smaller woodworking projects, many boxes for gifts, some wooden toys for all my friends who are having children these days, and the occasional furniture project for personal use.

While the price can be mostly recovered on lumber savings, my tiny shop is the final determining factor that prevents me from buying larger stationary tools.

		<title>Find the most ERGONOMIC Workbench Height for you</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As I started designing my own workbench, I had to carefully think about an ideal workbench height. I could only find arbitrary numbers, but nothing specific for my own height.

<strong>The ideal workbench height should be measured to your own needs. Your best reference is your body! Go get your work footwear and find what is the measurement betwwen your elbow height and the ground. As a rule of thumb, this measurement equals to a woodworking workbench height between 32" and 38" for people between 5'8" and 6'2". For more details on WHY you should choose this method, keep on reading below.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ideal-workbench-height.jpg" alt="" width="945" height="567" />
<h2>Why fixed 34 inches?</h2>
According to Wood Magazine, the "standard" workbench height is 34" in order to match most table saw heights and double as an outfeed table. Hand tool woodworkers use even lower 32" height for extra leverage during hand planing or chiselling sessions.

I'm 6'0" tall and that sounds like bending constantly. Just like every other "modern" construction "standard" such as sinks, kitchen countertops, and so on.

While I do understand that smaller shops need multitasking tools in order to make the best possible with the little available space, how many small wood shops have the budget and the space for a full blown cabinet table saw or a hybrid table saw? Marius Hornberger from Youtube is certainly an exception - and he doesn't look as tall as an average German.

I am more realistic and I believe most hobbysts are currently using smaller benchtop table saws. (I know I am.) My solution was to build a small cabinet to prop up my table saw, plus it doubles up as storage space for all my blades, push sticks, and a smaller crosscut sled.
<h2>Why fixed 38 inches?</h2>
Paul Sellers swears by a higher 38" workbench height that can serve people as tall as 5'11", and higher 42" workbenches for people who are taller - 6'2" or even 6'4". He speaks from experience both owning a factory in the past and as a woodworking teacher in the present.

I agree with what he says about the "standard" height being too low. Even traditional hand planing doesn't need such a low bench. Since a sharp plane will naturally tend to force the plane sole downward, most of the force applied is forward, and only minimal force is downward.

However I disagree with Paul Sellers when he says most people "adapt" to a 38" workbench height. Adaptability is good in the short term, since it gives you flexibility to stay productive and overcome obstacles no matter what your circumstances are. In the long term, adapting permanently to a bad situation can bring bad consequences as well. If you live in a big city, you have adapted to days of the year where the smog is literally killing you - one inspiration at a time.

This is why I believe you should measure your elbow height and custom build your workbench.
<h2>Why the elbow height?</h2>
The elbow height is the most ergonomic workbench height rule. It approximately corresponds to the "belly button" rule of thumb, which is another staple in woodworking. However, measuring your elbow ensures your arms and shoulders have the motion and the reach necessary for your style of woodworking:
<ul>
 	<li>Heavier woodwork that demands downforce, such as working with hand tools, requires worksurfaces from 8" to 16" below your elbow height.</li>
 	<li>Lighter woodwork, using power tools, and detailed woodwork, such as cutting joinery, asks for workbench heights from 8" to 16" below the elbow height.</li>
 	<li>As a final note, precision work, such as working with electronics, requires elbow support - add 2" to your elbow height and you are good to go.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Any final notes on workbench height?</strong>
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>Sure!
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li>Consider your type of woodworking. If you often build bulkier items such as furniture, go for a lower workbench. This avoids excessive strain in your back when moving your workpieces around and in your shoulders when you are working against gravity to raise a tool and drill a hole or hammering a dowel.</li>
 	<li>On the other hand, go higher if you mostly make small, detailed boxes or wooden toys.</li>
 	<li>If you want to store items under your workbench, remember to leave 6" of clearance for your feet, both in height and in depth, so you can get closer to your workbench instead of keeping your feet too far and having to lean in an awkward position that forces your lower back.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Are there Health Hazards for Working Standing?</h2>
Standing is a natural body position, so in principle there are no problems. The issues begin when we need to be rigid in certain positions performing certain tasks for prolonged periods of time.

This limitation in body positions leads to less variations of posture and movement, which can cause issues such as blood pooling in the lower regions causing sore feet, swollen legs, and varicose veins. This pooling also causes to heart to overwork - since more blood is "stuck" in the lower areas, the heart needs to work harder to pump blood to other areas of the body.

Other health problems derive from poor posture and include general muscular fatigue, stiffness in the neck and shoulders, and lower back pain.
<h2>How to avoid health problems?</h2>
If you need only two items, remember these: wear comfortable (and safe) shoes and vary your posture. Diversity is key!
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>It is very important to change body position and posture frequently, so you relax muscle groups and promote blood circulation.</li>
 	<li>Another important element to pay attention when changing posture is to keep a symmetrical posture, which brings balance to the entire spine and distributes your weight evenly in your legs and feet.</li>
 	<li>Wearing safety footwear that is comfortable and allow wiggle space for your toes, in both height and width, also helps.</li>
 	<li>A slight heel may help decreasing strain in the Achiles tendon, but remember to take that into consideration when measuring your workbench height.</li>
 	<li>Anti-fatigue mats are also helpful in decreasing impact, especially when standing over hard cement floors. The way they work is by slightly allowing your body to sway, the mats allow you to move subtly and that already causes you to change body position, circulate your blood, and move your muscles.</li>
 	<li>Excessive cushioning in mats also causes fatigue, so don't go overboard - cork, wood, or rubber are the best materials.</li>
 	<li>And use slanted edges to avoid tripping on the mats.</li>
 	<li>Keep a seat nearby to take occasional rests, too!</li>
 	<li>Finally, remember to walk while you are working, especially to circulate the blood pooled in the lower areas of your body. Walking as little as ten steps is already helpful in decreasing the pressure in your leg veins.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Unless you publish a woodworking magazine or own a DIY YouTube channel, it is impossible to own every tool possible. The jigsaw, however, is a staple that should be present in every woodworking shop. It is especially useful for making curved cuts. But can you cut plywood without splintering?

<strong>The short answer is YES. All you need to do is to turn off the pendulum action on your jigsaw and use quality blades. The Bosch T101AO jigsaw blade to cut plywood retails for less than $10 for a pack of 5, much cheaper than a new sheet of plywood, and certainly worth every cent. Go slowly on the cut speed and you will have a clean cut on both sides of the plywood.</strong>

<h2>About Hardwood Plywood</h2>
Hardwood plywood is a great choice for furniture such as bookcases, tabletops, cabinets. In other words, any project that calls for a wide, ﬂat wood board. It’s cheaper and easier to work with and, most of all, it's more stable than solid wood. Most hardwood plywood comes with a finish-grade veneer on one side (the good side) and a lesser grade on the other. These three cutting methods will keep both sides splinter-free, with extra protection for the good side, if you follow a simple rule of thumb.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jigsaw-banner.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="222" />
<h2>How to crosscut plywood without splintering? Another 3 Methods For You</h2>
<strong>The best way to cut plywood without splintering is to have the saw's teeth entering the show side (the side that will show on the finished product) and exiting the back side. That means placing the good face down when using a circular saw, and the good face up when using a table saw. Keep on reading for details on how to protect both sides of the cut.</strong>

The three methods I am about to describe will consistently produce straight, splinter-free edges with few setup hassles.

The <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-circular-saw/">circular saw</a> works best for cutting pieces too wide to be cut on a table saw without a huge saw table. If you work on a small shop like me, you lack space to maneuver an entire sheet of plywood, plus your benchtop table saw won’t cut strips wider than 12" or so.

The table saw technique works much faster and is great for making multiple cuts of the same width. But when you’re wrestling with a full 4x8 sheet of plywood, even narrow cuts can be awkward and difﬁcult, so you may want to handle these cuts with the circular saw — especially if you’re working alone.

If your project calls for only one good plywood side, this is the only tip you‘ll need, but if you need two good sides, you’ll also need to use the scoring and taping technique.
<h2>Method 1 – Circular Saw</h2>
For the simplest method, you’ll need a circular saw and either a new plywood-cutting blade with 140 to 150 teeth or a 40-tooth carbide-tipped crosscutting blade. You’ll also need a good, sharp utility knife and a 4-ft. level to use for a “fence,” that is, a saw guide. If you don’t have a 4-ft. level, you can cut a 5-in. wide piece from the end of a 4x8 sheet of plywood and use the “factory edge” as a guide.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/circular-saw-banner.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="222" />

Before starting, rest the plywood on a ﬂat surface supported by scrap rigid foam strips or 2x4s running perpendicular to the direction of the cut. They support the plywood during and after the cut. If the plywood isn’t well supported, it will fall away near the end of the cut, binding the saw blade and/or tearing off the veneer. Mark both ends of the cut you plan to make and clamp the fence exactly on these two marks. Scoring with a utility knife keeps the veneer from being torn up by the exiting saw blade. Before cutting (good face down, remember), I determine the distance from the inside face of the blade to the edge of the saw base. Measure a practice cut to be sure this distance is correct.

Clamp your saw guide that exact distance away from and parallel to the scored line. Do a good job when clamping both edges of the straightedge during scoring and cutting. You don’t want the guide to slip in the middle of either process. Be sure to start your saw before touching the edge of the plywood with the blade or it may tear up the veneer at the start-up.

<strong>TIP</strong>: Sometimes the saw base will leave metal marks on your work. Test your saw by making a practice cut on a piece of wood similar to your project piece. If it marks the wood, apply masking tape to the bottom of your saw base. Wrap the ends of the tape over the edges of the table to prevent it from peeling during the cut.
<h2>Method 2 – Table Saw With Scoring Cut</h2>
Before crosscutting plywood on your table saw (good side up this time!), be sure your blade is sharp. If you’re buying a blade, a 10-in. carbide combination blade with 60 teeth is a good choice. It will work well for both crosscutting and ripping.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/table-saw-banner.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="222" />

Professionals who cut a lot of plywood use a special saw equipped with a small-diameter scoring blade on a front arbor. The scoring blade cuts a shallow kerf ﬁrst to prevent splintering, then a full-size blade completes the cut. Our method duplicates this technique but requires two separate cuts.

First, you’ll need to remove the table saw guard to make a cut that doesn’t go all the way through the wood. Crank the blade above the table about 1/16 in. so it’s just high enough to cut the thin veneer (Photo 5). Now make the scoring cut on the plywood’s surface. The tips of the teeth will cut even with the veneer‘s wood ﬁbers so the grain won’t tear. Second, replace the guard and crank up the blade to make the ﬁnishing cut.

To ensure perfect results, be sure the table saw fence is parallel to the blade. If it’s not, take the time to adjust it. The owner’s manual for your saw will tell you how.

When you’re crosscutting a wide piece of plywood, push it slowly through the blade. There’s a big difference between ripping a 6-in. wide board into two 3-in. boards and crosscutting a 3-ft. wide piece of plywood into two 1-1/2 ft. pieces. The increased distance between the blade and the fence, along with the wide and heavy plywood, makes caution a must. The plywood can bind between the blade and fence, causing a nasty kickback, so don’t rush or force the cut. If possible, enlist an assistant to help you, or support the plywood during the cut with side tables and outfeed rollers.
<h2>Method 3 – Router With Fence Board</h2>
This is an excellent way to trim pieces of plywood to exact size after you’ve rough-cut them oversize with a circular saw. It will also give a very smooth edge for applying edge-banding (veneer trim). You can also use this method when you need to trim just a little off the length, say up to 3/8 in., or make slight adjustments in the angle of the cut.

You need a router, a sharp 1/2—in. dia. ﬂush trim router bit (carbide is best) with a 1-in. cutting depth, and the 5-in. wide plywood fence described in the circular saw technique. A ﬂush trim bit has a bearing on the bottom that follows the edge of the fence that you’ve clamped along the plywood.

CAUTION: Don’t use a 4-ft. level as a straightedge for a ﬂush trim router bit.

First, using a straightedge, draw the cutting line 1/8 to 1/4 in. back from the edge of the plywood. Then clamp the fence board’s “factory edge” on that line. Flip the plywood over so the straightedge is on the underside of the plywood. Clamp the plywood to your workbench or sawhorse so the end hangs well over the edge.

Now make a short, 1-in. cut on the end by guiding the router backward against the fence. This keeps the veneer from tearing as you ﬁnish the next cut.

Finally, cut the rough edge from end to end, guiding the router slowly from left to right. Press the pilot bearing ﬁrmly against the fence board. Take care to keep the router base ﬁrmly on the plywood. If the router tips a little to the right as you cut, make another pass until the plywood edge is at 90 degrees to the plywood surface and completely smooth.

		<title>How much does a basement kitchen cost?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Entertaining friends and family in the basement can be a great thing, however it gets old really fast when you need to climb up and down the stairs for the Nth time because you need to grab ice, or check the oven, and so on. How much can it cost to build a kitchen basement?

<strong>The basement kitchen cost varies between $4,000 to $13,000. The barebones cost includes appliances, sink, cabinets, countertops, lighting, and materials. The higher figure also includes professional design and installation. It adds value to your home because it makes entertaining easier, but also because it creates the possibility of creating a complete guest suite if your basement already has a bedroom and a bath - you could also rent it and make a few extra bucks. Keep on reading for specifics on what needs to be done when building your own basement kitchenette.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kitchen-basement-banner.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="222" />
<h2>0. Planning and Permits</h2>
Proper planning is essential. The first thing to do is locating the hot and cold water, vent stack, and the electrical requirements. Locating your new kitchen near your laundry room will likely take care of the plumbing and the vent. You will need to understand whether your circuit panel needs upgrading or not - here the best thing is to consult with a local electrician, so you will know what and how you need to act and stay within the code.

Following code is important for two reasons. First of all, it makes your home safer. Second, it is easier to sell your home - and make more money - if everything is according to the rules. A buyer might not get approved for a loan if parts of your home are unpermitted.

While basement sinks and refrigerators are not a huge problem, stoves or ovens represent a potential hazard due to the risk of ventilation issues or a possible fire.
<h2>1. Plumbing</h2>
Plumbing is usually the most restrictive aspect of a new kitchen, so it is the first item that should be located. Call a plumber in order to locate your hot and cold water pipes, this way you can analyze your design possibilities based on the actual space contraints.

Once you decide on a plan, then it's relatively simple to clear the pathways and let the plumber do his thing - or get to working yourself. In any case, you have three main plumbing tasks.

The first one is to tie the new drain pipe into your home's existing waste system. The second is to vent the sink by tying into an existing vent pipe. And the third task is to install hot and cold water supply pipes. (Remember to turn off your main water supply!)
<h2>2. Wiring and Lighting</h2>
Even a small kitchen needs a lot of wire. That can become confusing and dangerous in no time. The best alternative is to call an electrician and let him do this job.

The basics on kitchen wiring codes are: (1) lights and outlets cannot be on the same circuit, because if a circuit trips while you are cooking, you would risk burning yourself trying to fumble your way in the dark; (2) each power-hungry appliance need its own dedicated circuit - that includes microwaves, electric cooktops, electric ovens, and garbage compactors.

Pay special attention to the lighting as well and make sure all the kitchen areas are lit. Group all your switches in a single place for extra convenience.
<h2>3. Cabinets and Countertops</h2>
The cheapest choice is to be flexible in design and visit either Ikea or your local home center. Ready-made stock cabinets are plenty and they can easily accomodade your needs. You can fill in gaps in corners or in between cabinets using "filler strips". Custom made cabinets can be a solution for an odd shaped space, however they will cost more.
<h2>4. Appliances</h2>
Installing appliances is mostly about reading instruction manuals and following instructions. Even sinks come with installation instructions these days.

Just make sure to pay attention before cutting any holes in yout countertop before installing a sink or a drop-in cooktop, because that could be an expensive mistake.

Another tip that will make your life easier: make as many plumbing hook-ups as possible before sliding your sink in place, because it will be easier to work with the extra space available.

And if you are using a gas cooktop, hire a pro to install the gas pipe, since a mistake here could have severe consequences.
<h2>5. Finishing Touches</h2>
Remember that the ideal tile covering can always wait a little bit longer and be temporarily replaced by a cheaper vinyl covering.

If you use moldings in other areas of your basement, using the same color and styling in your kitchen will make it part of the entire home, and not just an after-thought.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So you just bought an older house and, naturally, you want to make it a better place to live, or suitable and attractive to rent. You are probably asking yourself which home improvements are the best investment.

<strong>This is a very tough question to answer. Your best answers will come from real estate agents in your area. Only they can accurately tell you how much houses like yours can be expected to sell for, how long houses take to sell, and what buyers in your area like.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/new-paint-banner.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="222" />

<strong>The resale value of improvements depends very much on your house, too</strong>: Adding a second bathroom is generally a good investment, but adding vinyl siding on an older house may not be.

A <a href="http://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2018/">recent survey by Remodeling magazine</a> across 149 major US cities asked real estate agents to compare the average contractor cost of 21 projects with the amounts homeowners can expect to get back is their property were sold within one year.

In measuring these costs versus values, here is a summary of their results, expressed as the percentage of the cost a homeowner is likely to recover later:
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Upscale garage door replacement</strong> costs $3,470 and its resale value is $3,411 (<strong>98.3%</strong> cost recouped)</li>
 	<li><strong>Midrange manufactured stone veneer</strong> costs $8,221 and its resale value is $7,986 (<strong>97.1%</strong> cost recouped)</li>
 	<li><strong>Midrange entry door replacement (steel)</strong> costs $1,471 and its resale value is $1,344 (<strong>91.3%</strong> cost recouped)</li>
 	<li><strong>Midrange wooden deck addition</strong> costs $10,950 and its resale value is $9,065 (<strong>82.8%</strong> cost recouped)</li>
 	<li><strong>Midrange minor kitchen remodel</strong> costs $21,198 and its resale value is $17,193 (<strong>81.1%</strong> cost recouped)</li>
 	<li><strong>Midrange siding replacement</strong> costs $15,072 and its resale value is $11,554 (<strong>76.7%</strong> cost recouped)</li>
 	<li><strong>Upscale window replacement (vinyl)</strong> costs $15,955 and its resale value is $11,855 (<strong>74.3%</strong> cost recouped)</li>
 	<li><strong>Midrange universal design bathroom</strong> costs $16,393 and its resale value is $11,581 (<strong>70.6%</strong> cost recouped)</li>
 	<li><strong>Midrange bathroom remodel</strong> costs $19,134 and its resale value is $13,422 (<strong>70.1%</strong> cost recouped)</li>
 	<li><strong>Midrange window replacement (wood)</strong> costs $19,391 and its resale value is $13,468 (<strong>69.5%</strong> cost recouped)</li>
 	<li><strong>Midrange roofing replacement</strong> costs $20,939 and its resale value is $14,320 (<strong>68.4%</strong> cost recouped)</li>
 	<li><strong>Upscale grand entrance (fiberglass)</strong> costs $8,591 and its resale value is $5,809 (<strong>67.6%</strong> cost recouped)</li>
 	<li><strong>Midrange deck addition (composite)</strong> costs $17,668 and its resale value is $11,239 (<strong>63.6%</strong> cost recouped)</li>
 	<li><strong>Midrange bathroom addition</strong> costs $44,717 and its resale value is $26,769 (<strong>59.9%</strong> cost recouped)</li>
 	<li><strong>Midrange major kitchen remodel</strong> costs $63,829 and its resale value is $37,637 (<strong>59.0%</strong> cost recouped)</li>
 	<li><strong>Midrange master suite addition</strong> costs $123,420 and its resale value is $69,807 (<strong>56.6%</strong> cost recouped)</li>
 	<li><strong>Upscale bathroom remodel</strong> costs $61,662 and its resale value is $34,633 (<strong>56.2%</strong> cost recouped)</li>
 	<li><strong>Upscale bathroom addition</strong> costs $83,869 and its resale value is $45,752 (<strong>54.6%</strong> cost recouped)</li>
 	<li><strong>Upscale major kitchen remodel</strong> costs $125,721 and its resale value is $67,212 (<strong>53.5%</strong> cost recouped)</li>
 	<li><strong>Upscale master suite addition</strong> costs $256,229 and its resale value is $123,797 (<strong>48.3%</strong> cost recouped)</li>
 	<li><strong>Midrange backyard patio</strong> costs $54,130 and its resale value is $25,769 (<strong>47.6%</strong> cost recouped)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Remember that while the above ﬁgures are a national average and represent considerable experience on the part of the real estate agents, they are only a rough guide.

Because of the uncertainties involved, I believe you should make home improvements primarily for your own satisfaction, comfort and convenience. If you’re lucky, these improvements may also pay all when you sell your house.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>How to hang Drywall on walls By Yourself</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Cover your walls quickly and inexpensively with drywall.

It’s easy to hang and ﬁnish, and you even get to cover up your mistakes! You‘re pretty sure to come out a winner when taking on that drywall project, whether it's repairing a water damaged wall, building a new closet, or <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/basement-kitchen-cost/">ﬁnishing your basement</a>.
<h3>Drywall is (Almost) Goof-Proof</h3>
<strong>Drywall is easy to work with</strong>: it comes in large sheets, cuts with a utility knife and nails or screws directly to the framing. Those large sheets cover a lot of wall area, so the project moves quickly.

And whereas an “Oops, I goofedl" exclamation may send chills down the spine of a ﬁnish carpenter, drywallers don't worry. The material costs only about $5 per 1/2” x 4’ x 8' sheet, miscuts can be used elsewhere. and best of all you can cover up your mistakes during the ﬁnish process. <strong>There’s forgiveness for you!</strong>

In addition, drywall can provoke some unusual experiences. You just might ﬁnd yourself standing on a ladder, balancing a 40 pound section of drywall panel on your head, while trying to catch the ceiling joist with a screw! Or there may be some other surprises. Occasionally, walls aren’t square, or you’ll forget to cut out an electrical box. Sometimes while securing a panel you’ll swear that the stud is back there, but you just can’t seem to hit it with the screw.

But don‘t worry. While you can get into some perplexing situations, drywall is tremendously versatile.

<strong>You don’t need professional skills</strong>. Using a few simple tools and the techniques you’ll see you can make ﬁrst class ﬂat, smooth walls and ceilings.

Of course there still may be times when you‘ll want to hire a pro. Their big advantage is speed. So if tightly scheduled on a larger project, say several rooms, it‘s probably worth getting a bid or two from drywall contractors.
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
All in all, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drywall">drywall is pretty simple stuff</a>, just a compressed bed of gypsum with heavy paper glued to both sides. Its quality lies primarily in the strength and hardness of the paper, which eventually becomes your wall surface. Without the paper the gypsum core will crumble. However, the core essentially won’t burn, so it’s a good ﬁreprooﬁng material.

Don’t be confused by the ﬁre rated type, Type X, which contains ﬁre retardants to give a higher ﬁre rating. All gypsum drywall is ﬁre rated. Check with your local building inspector for your exact requirements.

The ﬁrst step in your project is to estimate the amount of material you‘ll need. One way is to simply add up the floor and ceiling square footage to be covered. Then add 15 percent for waste and buy that much drywall.

Another way is to visualize laying the drywall sheets (horizontally) on the walls, ﬁlling up the spaces like a jig saw puzzle, and count how many full sheets you‘ll need, adding a few extra for small sections and errors. Also count your outside corners, and plan to use a single piece of metal comer bead for each one.

Then head off to your local lumber yard or home center. The chart below lists the most commonly used drywall. Half-inch, the residential standard, is most widely used.

[table id=19 responsive=collapse /]

<strong>Plan to use the longest sheets possible to minimize joints</strong>. Unfortunately, however, the practical problem of getting them home and inside undamaged will limit your choice.

Have them delivered if that's economical. When using an auto rack, try securing 2x4s below and above the drywall to stiffen it, even with the shortest (8 ft.) pieces. Before purchasing the longer (10 ft. and 12 ft.) sheets, be sure you can maneuver them into your house. They're unwieldy, heavier and can be tough to get around corners and up or down stairs. Finally, avoid sheets with broken edges or corners and water stains. Moisture rapidly deteriorates drywall. Wet drywall is worthless.

Look for the 3/8-in. and 1/4-in. thick drywall, as well as the specialty materials shown, at drywall suppliers. Even if you don’t need specialty items. it's fun to drop in at one of these places and check out the variety of tools and materials available. If the salespeople aren’t too busy, go ahead and ask for tips on materials. techniques, or special problems.
<h2>Wall Preparation for Hanging Drywall</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>Just before closing up the walls, make sure everything is just right.</li>
 	<li>Add extra studs (photo 1) or blocks (photo 2) to support the drywall edges as necessary:</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drywall-wall-preparation-1-2.jpg" alt="" width="695" height="730" />
<ol start="3">
 	<li>Cover wire runs with a 1/16" metal plate when wires come within 1-1/4" of the stud face.</li>
 	<li>Mark pipe locations to make sure you won't nail them.</li>
 	<li>And finally, adjust the electical box depth to fit the drywall thickness.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Drywall Cutting Technique</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>Lay out the desired drywall size with your measuring tape.</li>
 	<li>Mark both edges of the front and snap a chalk line for a guide.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
 	<li>Score the paper with a sharp utility knife. You can use a straightedge to guide the cut as well.</li>
 	<li>Tap the backside at the scored line with your knee to break.</li>
 	<li>Slice the paper on the backside with a utility knife.</li>

<h2>Hanging Drywall</h2>
Successfully hanging drywall requires a curious combination of geometric precision and brute strength. Everything’s in rectangles and perpendiculars as you measure, mark, cut and then hoist each successive heavy piece into place.
<h3>List of tools for hanging drywall:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Drywall hammer</li>
 	<li>Nail apron</li>
 	<li><a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-drill-driver-kit/">Cordless drill/driver</a></li>
 	<li>Utility knife</li>
 	<li>Saw</li>
 	<li>Chalk line</li>
 	<li>Square</li>
 	<li>Tape</li>
 	<li>Rasp</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hanging drywall with nails or screws?</h3>
But before you make that ﬁrst cut, decide which fastening system to use — nails or screws.

Pros use screws, driving them with electric screw guns, which are actually heavy duty drills with special tips which sink the screws to the proper depth. Those tips are also magnetized so the screw sticks right to the screw gun and therefore can be driven with one hand, a great advantage in difﬁcult situations. Screws hold better than nails, so fewer are needed.

Usually, you can place screws a minimum of 12 in. on center (o.c.), whereas nails must be 7 in. o.c. Weighing the advantages, it’s probably easier to use screws if you own the screw gun or can get one. But nails work just ﬁne, especially for small projects and repairs. Keep some nails handy anyway for small pieces and comer beads.

<strong>Proper nailing and screwing technique is critical.</strong> The trick is to set the fastener just below the surface of the drywall so it can be hidden with joint compound. When you drive a nail or screw too deep so that the paper breaks or the drywall crushes, you compromise the fastener's holding power. Building inspectors tend to notice this error and may require more frequent fastening to compensate. While the special drywall hammer isn‘t necessary. Its convex head helps set the nails just right. If you use an ordinary hammer, avoid breaking the drywall paper on that last blow. Use 1-1/4 in. drywall screws and 1-1/4 in ring shank nails for both 1/2 in and 5/8 in. drywall.

Hang the ceiling panels before the walls and be prepared for some heavy lifting. Ask a friend to help out. A “dead-man" really helps, too. To make one cut a 2x4 2 in. shorter than the ceiling joist height and nail a 3 ft. piece of 2x4 ﬂat on one end. Then simply draw it up under the drywall once you hoist the sheet up into place. Be sure to mark the joists along the walls so you can ﬁnd them with your fasteners on the ﬁrst try. Incidentally, to save wear and tear on your head when balancing a drywall sheet on it, try slipping a sponge under your hat.

You won’t have to completely fasten each piece at this stage. A dozen screws will hold it adequately. Concentrate on getting the entire ceiling hung initially, then return and fasten the whole thing off at once. Here‘s a tip: You can skip the fastener on the drywall edge next to the wall. That edge will be adequately supported from beneath by the wall panels and ﬁnish taping.

<h3>Tips for hanging</h3>
Don’t worry about gaps up to even 1/2 in. As long as you fasten the drywall securely, these gaps can be ﬁlled later and will not create a problem. If the gaps get larger, however, recut the piece, saving any miscuts for slightly smaller sections. And use some of those smaller pieces in closets and other less visible areas.

If all the walls and ceilings are ﬂat and square, everything should go along trouble free.

Unfortunately, as most remodelers know, over the years houses tend to shift: ceilings may sag, foundations settle, and walls go askew. Sometimes studs or joists are simply uneven. When you discover that those factory-cut rectangles of drywall don’t fit or begin to look wavy, stop and assess the problem.

Here it’s nice to be able to unscrew a panel or two if necessary. It's virtually impossible to pull those ring shank nails without ruining the drywall. A solution for uneven walls is to plane down protruding studs and fur out the receded ones.

To fur out is simply to add spacer pieces. Inexpensive plywood paneling about 3/16 in thick cut into 1-1/2 in. strips works well for this. Apply several layers to the framing if necessary. To flatten a sagging ceiling, fur the joists which are high Above all, try to keep the factory cut edges of the drywall aligned. If one piece becomes crooked, each subsequent piece will be off.
<h2>Finishing Drywall</h2>
The secret of drywall ﬁnishing is (1) patience and (2) a “mud” spattered radio tuned to an oldies station. (“Mud" is the slang term for joint compound.) While taping the joints and smoothing surfaces is repetitious and tedious, here's where you get to cover up any of those drywall hanging mistakes. In short, a careful job here makes your whole effort look good.
<h3>Materials needed for finishing drywall:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Quick-set compound</li>
 	<li>Mud pan</li>
 	<li>6" taping knife</li>
 	<li>Sanding block</li>
 	<li>100-grit sandpaper</li>
 	<li>12" taping knife</li>
 	<li>Paper tape</li>
 	<li>Joint compound</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to finish drywall yourself</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>Gather all materials needed.</li>
 	<li>Fill joint gaps with quick-set compound using 6" knife. Avoid excess as material dries very hard.</li>
 	<li>Load 6" knife with joint compound and fill tapered joint with as few strokes as possible.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
 	<li>Press paper tape into mud bed with knife and cover with a smooth, thin layer of compund. Allow to dry.</li>
 	<li>Lay paper tape in 1/16" bed of mud for non-tapered joints and cover with thin layer of compound.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="6">
 	<li>Apply at least 1/16" of compound to both sides of inside corner with 6" knife.</li>
 	<li>Crease paper tape in center and press into corner, covering each side with thin layer of mud.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="8">
 	<li>Press tape into 1/16" mud bed to coved large gaps around electrical boxes. Also mud fastener dimples.</li>
 	<li>Apply a second coat of mud to joints with 12" knife after the first coat dries. Feather (taper) edges.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="10">
 	<li>Feather nin-tapered joints 10-12" with second coat to reduce visible hump in the flat wallboard surface.</li>
 	<li>Spread second coat of mud on one side of inside corner, allow to dry, then apply second coat to other side.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="12">
 	<li>Apply successive mud coats to outside corners to cover metal. Bead provides good knife guide.</li>
 	<li>Smooth a very light third coat over all mudded areas. Thin the compound slightly with water.</li>

<ol start="14">
 	<li>Sand lightly to ease any remaining edges, lumps, etc. Wear a dust mask. Wear goggles for overhead work.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Tips for finishing</h3>
To hide the joints and fasteners you‘ll need to apply a special paper tape and three coats of joint compound. Why three coats? The mud shrinks as it dries, so it takes three layers to ﬁll up the depressions to make the surface flat. In addition, each coat can be made increasingly smoother.

When you buy the mud, try using one of the new lightweight joint compounds (Gold Bond Lite or US. Gypsum Plus 3, for example) They shrink less. so in areas not highly visible you may need only two coats. Purchase it pre-mixed in those 5 gallon plastic pails. Use paper tape for the joints.

(Fiberglass tape may also be used, but it requires a special hardening joint compound for adequate bonding. Since it does not come pre-mixed and it sets (hardens) rather quickly, you can only mix a little at a time. So using it may not be worth the trouble except, perhaps, for smaller projects.)

Use a quick-set compound for ﬁlling deep cracks, since it bonds well, doesn‘t shrink, and hardens quickly enough to recoat within several hours. Unfortunately, it sets very hard. So try not to leave any protruding above the drywall surface or you‘ll need a belt sander to remove the excess material.
<h3>Basic drywall taping principle</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drywall-taping-techniques-wide.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="452" />

<strong>Embed the tape in the ﬁrst coat and ﬁll and smooth with the next two coats. Taping a tapered joint is quite easy. You’re simply ﬁlling and smoothing the factory-made depressed edge. The non-tapered joints require more care, since the thickness of the ﬁrst coat and tape form a bump which needs to be hidden Gradually draw the second and third coats out widely to obscure that rise.</strong>

Of course, the thinner that ﬁrst coat can be made, the easier you can hide the taped joint. But, problems may arise if you leave the mud bed too thin. The tape won’t stick well. It‘ll “bubble” in places. Bubbled tape should be immediately pulled off and retaped. If the tape is already partially dry and the bubbling limited to a few spots, cut them out with a utility knife and retape those sections.

Another common problem is smoothing the third coat. Frequently hard bits of dried mud or grit get on your knife and leave ridges and grooves in the ﬁnish surface. Remove the embeded lumps with your ﬁnger and resmooth. Prevent the problem by cleaning your mud pan before reﬁlling it, and throw away extra mud rather than returning it to the pail.

Apply three coats of mud to screw and nail dimples as well at to the metal corner bead. The comer head not only withstands the inevitable bumps every corner receives. It also provides a smooth guide for the mudding knife to make the corners ﬂawless and crisp. If a corner bead looks as if it requires a lot of mud, use the quick-set compound for the ﬁrst coat to avoid shrinkage.
<h3>Drywall sanding</h3>
The ﬁnal step, sanding, is <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/how-to-keep-clean-floors-at-home/">notoriously messy</a>.

Drywall dust seems to inﬁltrate everything, so seal up doorways with plastic and masking tape, wear a dust mask, and put a fan in a window to draw the dust outside. It's an incentive to apply mud sparingly and to make that third coat as smooth as possible.

Actually, when mudded carefully the sanding will only be cursory, just to knock off a few lumps and feather some edges. Be careful not to rough up the paper. If you plan to texture, skip the third coat and sanding, since the texture will hide any irregularities.

Then put your work to the test. Prime with a good primer and examine the wall for imperfections. If you ﬁnd some, mud them, sand lightly, and reprime.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Are damp basements inevitable? As I went house hunting last month, I saw one basement that was very humid and I went online to try and find out why basements get damp.

<strong>There are three main culprits for damp basements. Concrete channels water inside our homes by capillarity -- a fancy term for water traveling through concrete's tiny pores. Water vapor from the warmer outside air can also condensate in the cooler basement walls and floor. Other condensation sources can be caused by your own doing as well, such as a shower without a fan, an unvented dryer, or even stored firewood.</strong>

<p class="box">UPDATE: I just published a new article about <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/wet-basement/">fixing your damp basement</a>, follow the link to check it out!</p>

<h3>Coping With Moisture</h3>
If homes were perfect, the basement, crawl space, or concrete foundation slab of every single one would be desert-quality, arid, throat-parching. dusty, bone dry.

There'd be no wet doors at damp walls. No fungal growth, wood rot, or smelly mildew. No peeling paint, stained wallpaper, or rusting nails. You could even lay a hardwood ﬂoor without worrying about the boards curling and warning. And your basement would make first-class living space.

But all too often, basements are too damp to be comfortable. Those solid concrete or concrete block foundations that support our homes and make up the basement walls — even concrete slabs that lie on top of the soil — not only get damp, but even worse, channel moisture into our homes rather than blocking it out. As we sketch out the reasons our foundations seem to work against us, we'll get a good picture of why it's so hard to get rid of basement dampness.
<h2>Stopping Leaks</h2>
Strange as it may seem, it's often easier to stop basements from leaking than it is to put an end to other dampness that makes them so uncomfortable.

Most basements leak because rainwater or snowmelt collects near your home's foundation and then works its way in through cracks or holes. The simple solution is to channel that water away. Extending downspouts well away from the foundation and sloping the soil away generally do the trick. It also helps to fill low areas of your yard so water doesn't puddle and slowly seeps toward the foundation. Slope walkways away from the house, too.

These steps will solve most leak problems, and will certainly reduce dampness. They might even stop it, but dampness can be persistent because it enters your home in several completely different ways.
<h2>How Concrete Channels Water</h2>
<strong>Dampness from saturated soil after rain can seep against the basement wall. Capillarity in the concrete draws on through to the inside. Capillarity also draws water up from saturated soil at the water table. This water can enter the footings and floor from below.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-966" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/damp-moist-basements-1-concrete-capillarity.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="997" />

Let's take a close look at the concrete foundation first. As solid-looking and strong as concrete is, it's actually full of tiny pores.

Even watertight concrete is porous. While the concrete won't necessarily leak, that is, allow water to run right through it, those pores literally draw water into themselves. Like tiny suction pumps.

Since these pores interconnect with others in a vast network, they continually draw the water onward, progressively filling all open spaces. This process, known as "capillarity," goes in all directions, even upward, soaking up water from any available source and wetting drier areas. In solid concrete or masonry structures, capillarity can easily raise water up to the second ﬂoor!

Fortunately, a concrete wall or floor can hold a lot of water without leaking because the pores retain the water. they don't let it leak out. However, when water soaks all the way through a wall or floor to the inside surface, it'll wet anything it touches, like wood, carpeting, and insulation. That's the main source of moisture, which causes mold, mildew, and rot. Moisture will also evaporate off the wet walls, saturate the air, and make everything else feel damp, too.

Of course, for capillarity to work, it has to have a water supply. It has three common sources:
<ol>
 	<li>Water steadily works its way upward through the soil from the reservoir in the ground (the water table) by capillary action, too, and commonly soaks into concrete foundations and slabs from below (see image)</li>
 	<li>Rainwater, as it sinks downward through the soil, seeps against the foundation and can soak in.</li>
 	<li>Rainwater that splashes up against the sides of the foundation can soak into the concrete.</li>
</ol>
You might be able to limit the splashing, but you're obviously not going to have any luck blocking the water table or stopping the rain.
<h3>Identifying Capillarity</h3>
It might take a little detective work, but it's usually not difficult to figure out whether capillarity is at work in your basement.

The big clue should stand out clearly on the bare concrete: a powdery white line that mysteriously shows up on your walls or floor.

If you look at the powder closely with a magnifying glass, you'll see that it consists of many tiny crystals that look like table salt. They are indeed a variety of mineral salts but not the kind at salt you flavor your food with, so don’t taste it!
<h3>What is efflorescence?</h3>
These salts, called "efflorescence," are the sure sign of water movement.

<strong>Efflorescence originally comes from the ground outside or sometimes from mineral residues left in the concrete. Water dissolves these minerals and carries them along through the concrete, finally depositing them when it evaporates off the inside wall or ﬂoor.</strong>

While you can find the crystals anywhere where there is moisture, they're concentrated at the highest point of water penetration, leaving a telltale line on the wall. This "tide line" might be several inches wide, as the efflorescence rises and falls with the ebb and flow of moisture in the soil around your house.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-967" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/damp-moist-basements-2-efflorescence.jpg" alt="" width="562" height="825" />

<strong>Efflorescence, minerals deposited as water evaporates, commonly appears at the highest point that capillarity carries water. Efflorescence often occurs on the exterior near ground level as well as on the inside.</strong>

The presence of efflorescence doesn't mean your concrete wall is deteriorating. It's harmless, and you can brush it away. However, expect it to return because where minerals appear on the wall's surface. you can bet there are more just under the surface. <strong>The only way to stop efflorescence is to eliminate the water</strong>.

Unfortunately, that's not easy.

The time to anticipate and stop capillarity was when workers laid the foundation — from the outside.

A proper foundation wall has a damp-proofing coat (asphalt, plastic, or another impervious layer) on the exterior to keep moisture out or the walls, and good drainage alongside the walls leading to a drain pipe at the bottom (the footing).

A damp-proof layer between the footing and wall, or a coarse gravel bed beneath, stops capillarity from below. And a polyethylene (plastic) membrane or bed of coarse gravel underneath protects the concrete floor. Coarse gravel stops capillarity because the gaps between stones are too large to draw water.

Of course, you usually can't tell how thoroughly workers damp-proofed your foundation unless you dig it up. That's an expensive project, although perhaps worthwhile if you have serious moisture problems. Consult your local building inspector and several contractors who specialize in basement moisture problems before taking this step.

<strong>Efflorescence will definitely limit your success if you try to block capillarity from the inside.</strong>

Capillarity usually keeps the wall that's below the tide line damp, although above that line the wall will remain dry unless moisture from rainwater soaks through higher up. Manufacturers simply don't formulate paints or other wall coverings to stick to wet surfaces, so no matter what coating you try, it'll fail and begin to crack and peel within a few years.

Even worse, the mineral salts temporarily blocked from emerging on the surface of the wall, will crystallize below the surface, inside the concrete pores, and crack off the surface of the concrete. So after a few years down the line when you clean off the peeling paint, you'll find that your concrete wall has begun to crumble along the tide line or wherever there is efflorescence.

There's not much good news when it comes to stopping capillarity once it's in your walls and door. The best solution is to keep as much water away from your foundation as you can.
<h2>More Dampness: Water Vapor</h2>
Capillarity isn't the only source or dampness. The second culprit is water vapor.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/damp-moist-basements-3-moisture.jpg" alt="" width="558" height="823" />

<strong>Moisture from high humidity condenses on and within cool walls. This moisture can also carry minerals to the wall surface.</strong>

We recognize water vapor best as the humidity in the air. Though we don't often think of it, concrete contains air, too, in exactly the same pores that cause capillarity. In fact, water vaporizes inside concrete from the pool of water that capillarity draws up.

This water vapor spreads through the concrete, heading to wherever the air is drier. Eventually, it filters into your basement, raising the humidity and increasing the feeling of dampness.

Fortunately, you can successfully paint concrete above the tide line and block water vapor movement into your basement. "Block" is actually too strong a word here. "Retard" is better, because paint slows water vapor movement, but doesn't completely stop it.

Of the three types of paints readily available, <strong>alkyds (enamels) retard vapor better</strong> than latex (acrylics) and concrete-based coatings, though all block most vapor.

No matter what type of paint you use, <strong>buy good quality paint specially formulated for concrete</strong> so it bonds well and lasts a long time. Scraping and cleaning a concrete surface for repainting isn't fun — you won't want to do it often.
<h3>Dampness From The Air</h3>
The third source of basement dampness doesn't come from the ground or the concrete. Moisture circulates throughout your home in the damp air, during periods of high humidity, usually in summer. Sometimes, you'll discover high-humidity sources within your basement, like a shower without a fan, an unvented dryer or stored firewood.

Basement walls and doors are cool since they're in contact with the cooler surrounding soil. When warm humid air strikes these cool surfaces, water condenses on them. And if a wall surface is warm, water vapor can move into the wall and actually condense inside the concrete where it's cooler. In either case, you'll end up with wet walls or floors and possible mold and mildew problems.
<h2>What type of dampness source do I have in my basement?</h2>
It's not always easy to determine whether the source of moisture in a basement is humidity or capillarity. The efflorescence tide line clearly shows capillarity. But condensation can be at work, too.

One way you can check for condensation is to tape a 2-ft. sheet of aluminum foil tightly to the wall or floor and examine it over several days to see it condensation develops on its surface. Another sign of condensation is water trickling down a painted wall.

But without one of these signs, you can't easily tell where your moisture is coming from condensation or capillarity.

You'll have to wait for an extended period of low humidity, of say, several weeks to a month. That'll stop condensation and give your basement time to dry out should condensation be the problem. If the dampness continues, you'll know capillarity is at work.

If condensation proves to be the culprit, you're in luck, because you can control the high humidity that causes condensation with a dehumidifier (or air conditioner, which does virtually the same thing).

Or, if your basement is otherwise dry, you can get rid of those cold walls by insulating them on the inside and installing a vapor barrier over the insulation. (You could also insulate walls from the outside, but that's more costly.) It's harder to insulate cool concrete floors to stop condensation. In that case, dehumidification is probably the best defense.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The workbench is the center of any workshop. This design fits in just about any shop space, whether it's a corner of the garage or a wall in the basement. It has a 2x6-ft. work surface, two shelves for storage, and a handy area to store your shop vacuum.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/garage-workbench.jpg" alt="" width="1136" height="871" />

When it comes to building with lumber, I like to keep waste to a minimum. This workbench's design does just that.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/garage-workbench-cut-list.jpg" alt="" width="1290" height="792" />

All the 2x4 components (legs, shelf brackets, and home) are cut from five 12-ft. 2x4s, with only a few inches of waste per board. The shelves, end panels, and top are cut from two 1/2-in. thick 4x8-ft. sheets of sanded AC-grade fir plywood. Again, waste is minimal.
<h2>Tools needed</h2>
You'll need a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-circular-saw/">circular saw</a> to cut the lumber and plywood. and an electric drill. A 3/8-in. variable speed, reversing drill with a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/best-drill-bit-set/">Phillips head driving bit</a> is best.

<a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/can-you-cut-plywood-with-a-jigsaw/">Cutting the plywood</a> can be tricky, so use a cutting guide and take your time measuring and checking for square before starting the cut.
<h2>Step-by-step instructions and pictures</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-975" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/garage-workbench-exploded-view.jpg" alt="" width="1159" height="1065" />
<h3>Building the Workbench</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>Assemble the three 66"-long, main frame components and legs, using 2-1/2" drywall screws. PRedrill the holes to prevent splitting and to draw the pieces snug.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-976" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/garage-workbench-1.jpg" alt="" width="616" height="705" />
<ol start="2">
 	<li>Install the shelf frame components. The height of the upper shelf can be adjusted to fit your needs, but you'll need to alter the size of the inner shelf end panels accordingly.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-977" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/garage-workbench-2.jpg" alt="" width="583" height="503" />
<ol start="3">
 	<li>Attach the side panels and back panel. These panels help stabilize the bench and prevent tools and equipment from falling off.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-978" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/garage-workbench-3.jpg" alt="" width="741" height="524" />
<ol start="4">
 	<li>Tack the bottom sheet of the workbench top to the frame with 4d or 6d nails. Make sure the sheet is flush with the back edge of the workbench frame and that there's a 1-1/2" overhang on each end.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/garage-workbench-4.jpg" alt="" width="605" height="566" />
<ol start="5">
 	<li>Spread wood glue over the entire top surface of the tacked plywood. The glue prevents gaps between the two 1/2" sheets of AC plywood that form the workbench top.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-980" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/garage-workbench-5.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="569" />
<ol start="6">
 	<li>Place the remaining sheet of AC plywood onto the glued sheet, with the sanded side up. Secure them together with 2-1/2" drywall screws. Make sure the screws penetrate into the workbench frame.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-981" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/garage-workbench-6.jpg" alt="" width="678" height="605" />
<h2>Time, Cost, And Tips</h2>
The workbench components can be cut and assembled in under four hours and you shouldn't have to spend too much on the materials (2x4s, plywood, and 2-1/2 in. drywall screws).

You probably could use a helper during a couple of the assembly steps, such as attaching the legs to the longer frame components and installing the 2x4 shell pieces.
<h2>Top tip</h2>
Finally, here's a tip to make assembling the pieces easier: Before you secure the 2x4 components together, predrill the holes for the screws.

This reduces the chance of splitting the lumber and helps draw the components snugly together.
<h2>Storage ideas</h2>
If your shop area's going to be located where there's an open stud wall (no drywall covering the interior wall), you've just discovered an often overlooked storage area.

<strong>Mount shelves and brackets to the studs</strong>. Every open stud cavity - the space between two adjacent wall studs - can be converted into a mini-storage area.

Here's how:
<h3>Brackets and Shelves</h3>
Cut the brackets from 2x4-in. pine. Make the shelves from 1x12-in. pine hoards.

Secure the 15-in. long. 2x4 horizontal brackets to the wall studs with 2-1/2 in. drywall screws. Then mount the angled 2x4 braces to the studs and to the horizontal brackets with 2-1/2 in. screws. Predrill the hole for the screw that goes through the angle bracket and into the horizontal bracket.
<ol start="7">
 	<li>Attach the 15" long horizontal support to the wall stud. Then secure the diagonal brace to the bottom of the horizontal support and the wall stud. Use 2-1/2" drywall screws.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/garage-workbench-7.jpg" alt="" width="394" height="371" />
<ol start="8">
 	<li>Position the shelf on the horizontal support and secure with 1-1/2" drywall screws. Predrill the holes for the screws.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-983" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/garage-workbench-8.jpg" alt="" width="403" height="373" />
<h3>Between-Stud Shelving</h3>
<ol start="9">
 	<li>Install 2x6 and 1x4 boards between the studs with 2-1/2" drywall screws in predrilled holes. Set adjacent shelves at different heights.</li>
 	<li>On 2x6 shelves, cut and then round off the corners with a file or sandpaper. A 2x6 shelf will hold gallon cans.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/garage-workbench-9.jpg" alt="" width="798" height="576" />

The 1x12 shelf can be any length, but the distance between brackets shouldn't be more than 4 ft., and the shelf shouldn't extend more than 18 in. beyond the brackets. If you want a shelf longer than 6 ft., be sure you add brackets in the middle so the shelf won't sag.
<h4>Store Your Cans Of Paint And Stain</h4>
Install shelves cut from 1" x 4" or 2" x 6" boards. Your choice will depend on the size of the cans you need to store. Here are some guidelines:
<ul>
 	<li>A 1" x 4" board will hold quart-size cans, as well as most aerosols.</li>
 	<li>You can almost double the amount of quart-can storage if you use 2" x 6" boards.</li>
 	<li>A 2" x 6" board will also safely hold two 1-gal. cans.</li>
</ul>
A word of caution about loading the shelves: if you decide to use the between-stud shelves, position them so that you can't stack items more than one row high. This will prevent overloading. Instead, install more rows of shelves.

Also, stagger the shelf position to make screw installation easier. Use 2-1/2" drywall screws to secure shelves to wall studs.

Finally, note the rounded corners on the 2x6 boards. This reduces the chance of injury from a protruding corner. To round the corners, cut them at a 45-degree angle and then file or sand smooth before you install the shelves.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you are planning to add a room to the south side of your house and have been considering a sunspace design, here is what you need to know.

<strong>Sunspace style rooms are an attractive and practical way to add space to your home. People use these rooms for everything from year-round garden/solariums, to a new kitchen area, to a whirlpool/spa room, to very simply, extra living space.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1032" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/south-side-sunspace.jpg" alt="" width="783" height="688" />

A sunspace lets you enjoy the seasons, without suffering from temperature extremes. They let the heat of the winter sun in and keep the summer heat out, using insulated windows and a variety of shade and window blind applications to control the sun's rays. According to their manufacturers, some are also designed to act as passive solar heating systems.

Sunspace additions are available in kits for the do-it-yourselfer. Most dealers have installers who'll do the work for you, if you prefer. Remember, the construction of a sunspace is similar to other room additions, and all local building codes (for foundation, footings, electrical and plumbing) must be followed.

You can find more information at the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/sunrooms-and-sunspaces">Department of Energy website</a> or in this <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/energy/P-I/Solar/docs/sunspace.pdf">brochure</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunroom">Wikipedia</a> also has basic info on the subject.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just squeeze to fasten! Some tools are like coffee; sure, you could live without them, but once you get in the habit you sure wouldn’t want to.

The staple gun is like that — addictive. Its forte is light-duty fastening: paper, plastic, screen, and fabric. It’s a versatile tool for decorating projects, like upholstering chair seats and valances, and for home improvement projects ranging from weatherstripping to major remodeling. And since you can get a good staple gun for super cheap, it‘s a wise buy.
<ol>
 	<li>Stapling at an angle in fabric and screen is stronger because the staple has more material to grip.</li>

<h2>Staple gun operation</h2>
Using a staple gun is straightforward; just hold it ﬁrmly to the work surface and squeeze. A manually operated stapler does require some force, so if your hands are small you should test different models before buying. Electric staplers are effortless.

There aren’t many tricks to using a staple gun. With fabric and screen, the staples will grip better if they are at a diagonal to the grain of the fabric, so the stress is spread out. Choose your staple length carefully for maximum holding power.
<h2>Choosing staples</h2>
Here are some typical uses for different sizes of staples.
<ul>
 	<li>1/4 in. are for very light duty, like attaching window shades to rollers.</li>
 	<li>5/16 in. and 3/8 in. are intermediate sizes, good for weatherstripping, attaching insulation, fabric, screen and paper.</li>
 	<li>1/2 in. and 9/16 in. are for heavy uses, like attaching rooﬁng felt, and for thick materials like ceiling tile. There is a special 9/ 16-in. staple designed for ceiling ﬁle, with legs that spread apart for extra holding power.</li>
</ul>
You should buy staples made by the manufacturer of your stapler. My advice is to buy a good assortment of staples so you’ll be ready for any quick chore.
<h2>Specialized staplers</h2>
If you like to reupholster furniture, or have other chores involving lots of staplers, consider buying an electric stapler. You can buy one for cheap too, and they are speedy, easier on the hands, and more convenient for overhead work.

They take all standard size staples, and do a more consistent job with long staples in tough materials than you can do manually. There are also models that drive small brads for picture framing or crafts. However, none of the electric staplers are designed to do the kind of heavy stapling of wood to wood that air-powered industrial staplers do.

For remodeling and construction, a hammer stapler is great for attaching vapor barrier, insulation, roofing felt, and even shingles. It makes working above your head much easier, holds a ton of staples, and lets you drive staples all day without tiring your hand. The extra force you get with a hammer stapler makes it easier to drive long staples. Larger models drive extra heavy-duty 3/4-in. staples, with wide crowns, that are particularly well suited to fastening asphalt shingles.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Checking Constant Velocity (CV) Joints</title>
		<link>http://bestlife52.com/?p=1113</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Car owners need to add an important visual check to their maintenance schedule when they become owners of a front-wheel-drive vehicle: the constant velocity (CV) joint. Here's why.
<h2>What is a CV Joint?</h2>
The heart of every front-wheel-drive unit is the constant velocity (CV) joint. This clever device transmits engine power to the front wheels. Unlike the simple U-joint of rear-wheel-drive vehicles, the CV joint must transmit power through two different angles — up and down through the range of suspension travel, and side to side through the entire range of steering angles.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1115" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Checking-Constant-Velocity-CV-Joints-Detail.jpg" alt="" width="362" height="323" />

If you look under the front of your car, you’ll see a pair of accordion-ribbed rubber boots connected to each front wheel. The four CV joints are inside these boots which are packed with grease and tightly sealed. The accordion bellows allow the rubber boots to ﬂex through the angles and changes in length that the joint must go through.

Both the boots and the CV joint have to survive for many years and tens of thousands of miles in an incredibly hostile environment — hot. cold, wet, snow, ice, salt, stones, potholes and plenty of neglect. That they hold up as well as they do is why I'd rate the CV joint as a ﬁrst class piece of engineering and technology.
<h2>So what can go wrong?</h2>
The biggest enemy of CV joints is boot failure. A CV joint will quickly fail if it lacks proper lubrication or is exposed to road din, salt and debris.

The boot may split from fatigue, and vehicles operated in extremely cold weather are especially susceptible to boot failure on those sub-zero days. And of course rocks, potholes and other “object’ d’roadway” can tear the boot.
<h3>Inspect your CV joints regularly</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1114" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Checking-Constant-Velocity-CV-Joints.jpg" alt="" width="741" height="550" />Ever since the 1980’s, the world’s car makers in their quest for more fuel efﬁcient vehicles, have turned to smaller, front-wheel-drive cars.

The key to making the CV joints last the life of your car is to visually inspect the rubber boots at least every three months. Every time you change oil, look for evidence of grease leakage from the boots. Typically, a boot will begin to fail by cracking in the valley of one of the “Vs,” By turning the steering all the way to the lock and slowly rotating the wheel, you can inspect the boots carefully.

Even a quick inspection is helpful. Look for any evidence of grease on the outside of the boot or sprayed onto the surrounding suspension components. If everything is completely dry, the boot is most likely intact. But if there is any doubt, take a closer look.
<h2>What if the boot has failed?</h2>
It’s time to remove the drive axle and disassemble the CV joint for cleaning and inspection. It's not a DIY job and it’s not cheap, and the sooner this is done after discovering a torn boot, the better your chances of keeping the repair hill down.

Once removed, and after a thorough degreasing, the joint can be checked for excess wear or play. If the joint isn’t damaged. it can be repacked with grease and a new boot ﬁtted. If replacement is called for, you’ll be looking at several hundred dollars additional in parts and labor.
<h3>Audible Warnings</h3>
Listen for clicking or clunking noises from the drive shaft as you turn or accelerate. These noises indicate that the lack of grease and contamination from road grit have the CV joint on the road to certain failure.
<h2>Can the boot be replaced without removing the axle?</h2>
Yes, but we don’t recommend it. There are replacement boots that feature a seam so that the boot can be installed without removing the axle — this seam is the replacement boot’s weak point. If they really worked well the manufacturers would use them, and they don’t. More importantly, if the original boot has failed, the joint needs to be thoroughly cleaned and repacked with grease, something that cannot be done without removing the axle.
<h2>Should the CV joint be repacked periodically?</h2>
Not in most cases. Check your owner’s manual. Most manufacturers recommend periodic inspection only, and don’t suggest disassembly unless the boot has failed. Some car makers do suggest cleaning and repacking at speciﬁc intervals, so follow their recommendations.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A lot of different fluids can leak out of your car, To help you identify them, place a plastic container where the leak occurs, or if the leak is very small, a piece of white paper to capture its color.

Leaks are identified by physical evidence — smell, color, texture, etc. Once the leaks source is identified, sometimes simply tightening a clamp or bolt may solve the problem.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/identifying-car-fluid-leaks.jpg" alt="" width="683" height="498" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1288" />

<h2>Antifreeze/coolant</h2>

Usually green or yellow liquid with a faint, sweet odor. Old coolant will be rusty or dirty brown.

Look for leaks at the radiator, upper and lower coolant hoses, heater hoses, engine core plugs. Poisonous.

<h2>Automatic transmission fluid</h2>

Usually a light red oil. Compare it to that on the transmission dipstick.

The source is the automatic transmission, power steering pump, power steering hoses.

<h2>Battery acid</h2>

If it has a sulfur-like smell, it's probably sulfuric acid and water from a leaking battery.

Highly corrosive — if it touches skin or clothing, flush immediately with water.

<h2>Brake fluid</h2>

Clear, thin, almost water-like.

Leaking brake fluid is a danger sign requiring immediate attention. Get a mechanic to check.

<h2>Gasoline</h2>

Obvious by its sharp odor. Extremely poisonous.

Check at the fuel tank and all fuel lines.

<h2>Gear oil</h2>

A heavyweight oil, usually dark or black (a light tan when fresh).

Used in manual transmissions. axles, differentials; may show up on the CV axle boots of front-wheel drive vehicles.

<h2>Grease</h2>

Very thick, sticky. Compare it to residue near grease nipples.

Minor leakage after a grease job is normal.

<h2>Power steering fluid</h2>

Automatic transmission fluid (ATF) is commonly used and is often red.

Compare to fluid in power steering pump reservoir.

<h2>Shock absorber fluid</h2>

It usually shows up as a dark stain on the shock body itself.

Check all shocks. If leakage is found, replace the shock.

<h2>Water</h2>

If it looks and smells like clear water, it’s condensation from the air conditioner. This is normal.

<h2>Windshield washer solvent</h2>

Bluish in color, smelling of detergent or alcohol.

Persistent leakage indicates a cracked fluid reservoir or leaking hoses between the reservoir and the windshield. Poisonous.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Build a wooden wheelchair ramp</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you need to build wheelchair ramps for your front or doors and would like to use treated lumber instead of concrete, here is the best way to build your own ramps.

<strong>You can build a wheelchair ramp just like a deck. with footings, posts, joists, decking and railings (see illustration). Most states require that the ramp have no more than a 1:12 slope. This means that for every 12 in. you go along the ramp, you should go up no more than 1 in. For persons with limited strength, 1:20 may be better. Be sure to verify your slope with local building ofﬁcials.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/how-to-build-a-wheelchair-ramp-with-treated-lumber.jpg" alt="" width="643" height="625" />

You can build your ramp with treated lumber. but choose it carefully to avoid splits and warping, which can make rolling a wheelchair difﬁcult. Cedar and redwood, while more expensive, will not split and warp much. Rough-sawn lumber will give better traction.

ln climates with snow, it’s important to construct the surface of the ramp with 2x6 boards spaced 1/4 in. apart for drainage. This will provide a non-slip surface. The ramp should be 42-48 in. wide.

A 60 x 60-in. level platform should be located at the top of the ramp and installed level with the threshold of the doorway. Twenty-four inches of the platform should be on the latch side of the door.

For ramps more than 30 in. high, there should be a 60 x 60-in. level landing every 15 ft. You should also have such a landing at each direction change.

At the bottom of the ramp, you should pour a 72 x 72-in. level concrete pad and a sidewalk that connects the ramp to the driveway or street. The transition between the ramp and the concrete pad should be smooth, with a bump no greater than 1/ 4 in.

Guard railings should surround all outer edges of the ramp at a height of 36 in. Railing spindles are typically 2x25 on 6-in. centers. A second hand rail, 1-1/2 in. in diameter, should be installed at a height to ﬁt the user, spaced 1-1/2 in. inside the railings.

If you need more information, contact your local council on disability, or the <a href="https://accessiblebydesign.org/">Accessibility by Design Center</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990">Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990</a> (ADA) also has a publication named Standards for Accessible Design and its <a href="https://www.ada.gov/2010ADAstandards_index.htm">chapter 4</a> is all about ramps.]]></content:encoded>

As these photos showed, screening in aluminum frames is usually held in place with a rubber spline. Replacing the screening and spline is easy with the wheeled spline roller shown here; most hardware stores sell it for cheap.

It’s a good idea to replace the old spline while you're at it. Spline costs cents a foot. Bring an old piece along to the store, since it comes in several thicknesses.

Two kinds of screening are available: aluminum and fiberglass. Fiberglass comes in several colors, is more ﬂexible, and a bit easier to install. But it's also a little more easily damaged or stretched than aluminum, which is slightly more expensive.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>How to install Finish Trim you can be proud of (with detailed pictures)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Fine cuts and sharp corners: master these basic cutting and installation techniques and you will be able to apply finish trim with expert accuracy.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-997" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/finish-trim-862x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="662" />

Whether trimming out an entire room or simply replacing an unsightly piece of molding, you really want that finish trim to look sharp. Baseboards, door casings, and window trim create much of the grace, accent, and individuality of our homes. The well-crafted older styles — wide, thick, and sometimes fanciful — stamped a speciﬁc character on each room.

But times changed, and our contemporary trim, much slimmed down and simplified, has a reduced impact. In fact, when carefully installed with crisp corners and tight joints, you'll hardly notice modern trim. Rather than standing out, It tends to accent, outline, and frame a room.

However, let some joints loosen, or a miter fall to align and the trim pops back into View, with attention focusing on the poor fit.

It’s not difficult to solve this problem. To accurately apply finish woodwork you only have to master two basic cutting techniques, coping and mitering, and then follow the steps for installation.

Of course, there is no substitute tor experience, so practice these skills first with a soft wood like pine before moving on to a harder wood like oak.
<h2>CUTTING: mitering outside corners</h2>
<h3>Using a miter saw</h3>
The miter saw was designed precisely for trim work. If you can get your hands on one, you’ll complete your trim projects a whole lot faster and more accurately than ever before.

But they don't guarantee expertise. You’ll still have to cut as carefully and patiently as you would with a hand saw.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1000" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/finish-trim-miter-saw.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="353" />

&nbsp;

<strong>Hold trim tightly against cutting fence and slowly lower blade. Keep hands well away from blade.</strong>

The miter saw runs last and smooth, but it can be dangerous. Your hands will frequently be close to the blade, and loosely held material can kick out suddenly. Perhaps one of the best safety measures is to use a sharp, high quality cross-cut blade.

When mitering, cut your pieces a little long. The big advantage of the miter saw is its ability to shave cuts very cleanly. Miter the pieces about 1/4 in long, put them up for a trial ﬁt, and then shave them back a little at a time to get a perfect joint. This technique works particularly well when the comer being mitered isn't exactly 90 degrees.
<h3>Using a circular saw jig</h3>
Your <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-circular-saw/">circular saw</a> can do a ﬁne job of ﬁnish mitering if you give it a little help. Use a guide. For the occasional miter, a tightly held framing square may be all you need. For more frequent use, make up a simple jig from scrap material (see illustration).

If you carefully align the jig’s adjustable arm to the exact angle before screwing it down, simply return it to the same screw hole to get the same angle.

<a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/can-you-cut-plywood-with-a-jigsaw/">Splintering</a> is the biggest problem with this system. The best remedy is to use a sharp saw blade (usually the more teeth, the smoother the cut) and to cut from the backside of your stock, so the saw teeth out up through the ﬁnish face.
<ol>
 	<li>Use framing square as a saw guide for miter cuts. Saw from backside to avoid splintering.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/finish-trim-circular-saw-jig-2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="241" />
<ol start="2">
 	<li>Adjust jig for 45 degree angle cut, insert door casing, hold tight against edge, and cut.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/finish-trim-circular-saw-jig-3.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="243" />
<ol start="3">
 	<li>Adjust saw for miter and insert baseboard to be cut, again from the back. Use a sharp saw blade.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/finish-trim-circular-saw-jig-4.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="241" />

With a little practice, you’ll cut very accurate miters with this system and can tailor it to your own special needs.
<h3>Using a miter box</h3>
The old hand miter box, available in plastic as well as wood (both for about the same price). continues to be a practical choice for smaller miters.
<ol>
 	<li>Miter casing using pre-cut saw guides in wooden miter box. Use sharp, fine-toothed saw.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/finish-trim-miter-box-1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="261" />
<ol start="2">
 	<li>File a back-sloping bevel on the cut face to allow the finished edges to clse more tightly.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1007" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/finish-trim-miter-box-2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="320" />

You'll need a very sharp hand saw with ﬁne teeth (14 teeth per in.) to make ﬁne cuts. And expect to ﬁle the miter to get that tight ﬁt, since you won't be able to ﬁnely shave your trim with the hand saw:
<ul>
 	<li>It’s helpful to anticipate potential problems and make the ﬁrst cut accurate. Check the comer receiving the trim with your square to make sure it's 90 degrees. If not, compensate slightly on your cut.</li>
 	<li>File a slight bevel on the back of your cut to allow the front edge to close tightly.</li>
</ul>
The patience and technique learned here will improve your skills when mitering with power tools as well.
<h2>CUTTING: coping inside corners</h2>
<h3>Using a coping and a jig saw</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>Outline shape to be cut on baseboard with scrap piece or follow the line on the trim face left by a miter.</li>
 	<li>Cut outline with coping saw. Slim, narrow blade cuts on pull stroke can follow tight curves accurately.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1011" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/finish-trim-coping-saw-1-2.jpg" alt="" width="734" height="348" />
<ol start="3">
 	<li>Cutting with jig saw is faster, although not as flexible as coping saw. Tape protects baseboard finish.</li>
 	<li>Test fit to scrap piece. File out fine details and bevel back side for more accuracy, and a tighter joint.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/finish-trim-coping-saw-3-4.jpg" alt="" width="737" height="349" />
You can miter inside corners as well as outside, but you'll ﬁnd that inside corners frequently open up when nailed, leaving an unsightly crack.

Coping the joint solves this problem. The coped piece clamps the adjacent comer baseboard tightly to the wall, so that the adjoining piece need not be nailed. Then, nailing the coped piece holds both in place without forcing the joint open. Slick and clean.

As with miters. Bevel back the coped edge with a ﬁle to make a close ﬁt (especially with more complex moldings). Experiment using both the coping and jig saws. You’ll probably ﬁnd both to be handy — the jig saw for ﬂatter pieces like baseboard and the coping saw for more elaborate moldings.
<h2>INSTALLATION: door casing</h2>
After mastering the cutting techniques, it’s time for the ﬁnishing touch — installing the trim.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/finish-trim-door-casing.jpg" alt="" width="501" height="499" />

You've already smoothed and painted the walls. Stain or prime the trim in advance to simplify ﬁnishing. Then ﬁt and nail the door casings. (The baseboard will butt against them.)
<ol>
 	<li>Measure for top casing length. Be sure to add reveals. Miter all corners leaving side casings 1" long.</li>
 	<li>Hold miters tightly together on flat surface. Drill hole through corner for 4d finish nail to be added after trim is nailed up.</li>
 	<li>Center and tack top casing in place leaving 3/16" of top jamb edge exposed (reveal). Don't nail off until miters fit.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1013" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/finish-trim-door-casing-1-2-3.jpg" alt="" width="716" height="516" />
<ol start="4">
 	<li>Measure side casing by reversing ends, resting mitered end on floor, and marking top. Cut to length.</li>
 	<li>Install side casings. Secure with 6d finish nails to wall, 4d finish nails to jamb. Finally, tap in corner nails to tighten miter.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1014" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/finish-trim-door-casing-4-5.jpg" alt="" width="663" height="541" />
Check those jamb corners with your square to see if they are 90 degrees. If not, you’ll have to adjust your miters to ﬁt. Both sides of the miter should be cut at the exact same angle for a tight joint. Be sure to pre-drill the comer nail hole before putting up the casings. You can’t drill them in place without marring the wall. Allow the same reveal (see illustration) on all sides, since slight variations will stand out. And until everything ﬁts, drive nails only partially so they may be easily removed.

Finally, after driving and setting the ﬁnish nails, tap in the corner nail to align and tighten the miter.
<h2>INSTALLATION: window trim</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/finish-trim-window.jpg" alt="" width="501" height="513" />

Except for the stool (see illustration), install window trim just like door trim. In fact, you can omit the stool and simply add a fourth piece of casing beneath the window. But the stool retains a traditional look and, well, gives you another place to put your coffee cup.
<ol>
 	<li>Cut stool stock to length, center in opening, mark at side jambs, and measure depth of notch.</li>
 	<li>Cut out notch with jig saw. Subtract 1/16" from notch depth to allow sash to clear stool.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1016" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/finish-trim-window-1-2.jpg" alt="" width="674" height="336" />
<ol start="3">
 	<li>Level and fasten stool to window sill with 6d finish nails. Prop stool from below if needed.</li>
 	<li>Install casings using the door casing procedure: measure top, miter corners, cut sides.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1017" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/finish-trim-window-3-4.jpg" alt="" width="676" height="337" />
<ol start="5">
 	<li>Miter returns on apron ends. Make sure apron extends under side casings.</li>
 	<li>Pre-drill and nail apron to wall with 6d finish nails. Then nail stool down to apron with 4d finish nails.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1018" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/finish-trim-window-5-6.jpg" alt="" width="674" height="344" />

You can buy the stool material already milled to ﬁt over the window sill, although you may have to saw or plane it narrower.

Figure its length by adding the width between the jambs at the bottom, the reveals, the casing widths, plus 3/4 in. for the ends on each side.

Notch it to ﬁt between the jambs and stop about 1/16 in. from the window sash. This allows the window to open and close freely.

Level and nail the stool to the sill.

Later, after installing the casings and apron, support the apron with a block from the ﬂoor and nail down through the stool into the apron for further support.
<h3>How do I miter a return?</h3>
Whenever a molding terminates without butting another trim piece, dress up the end with a return. A "return" simply means that rather than ending abruptly, the molding turns the corner and seems to head into (return to) the wall. It’s a neat solution to the problem of unsightly ends.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1019" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/finish-trim-mitering-a-return.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="429" />
<ol>
 	<li>Miter apron ends, leaving 6" minimum scrap cutoffs. Miter cutoffs carefully.</li>
 	<li>Glue cutoffs to apron ends and secure with masking tape until glue dries.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/finish-trim-mitering-a-return-1-2.jpg" alt="" width="579" height="269" />
<ol start="3">
 	<li>Reinforce joint by nailing with 1" brads. Pre-drill to avoid splitting.</li>
 	<li>Saw off scrap flush with back side with a sharp hand saw. Saw or file smooth.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1021" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/finish-trim-mitering-a-return-3-4.jpg" alt="" width="581" height="271" />

To make a return in the window apron, measure the length and cut each end at 45 degrees as if you were mitering a baseboard corner. Allow at least 6 in. of scrap wood at either end. Miter each of these scraps and glue them to their respective apron ends. Over a long period the glue will weaken, so rely on mechanical fasteners (brads). They may be added while the glue is wet to help clamp the joint. Or you can add them after the glue dries. Then simply cut off the excess and install the apron as a single piece.

Mitered returns can come in handy in other places as well. Use them with baseboard and steal ends to avoid exposed end grain, as well as with more decorative moldings — base shoe, chair rails, picture moldings, and crowns.
<h2>INSTALLATION: baseboards</h2>
Install baseboard tightly to the floor or raised 3/8 in. using spacer blocks it you intend to install carpeting. Raising it allows more of the narrow modem styles to show and provides a place to tuck the carpet edge as well.

There are several ways to enhance your baseboard’s attractiveness. Buy your material in sufﬁcient lengths to avoid splicing short pieces (see illustration). By planning the lengths needed you can also avoid waste.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1022" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/finish-trim-baseboard.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="460" />
<ol>
 	<li>Cut baseboard to rough lengths and set in place. Put nicest pieces in most visible areas.</li>
 	<li>Mark baseboard and miter outside corner first. Draw lines along lower edges to help align cut.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1023" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/finish-trim-baseboard-1-2.jpg" alt="" width="679" height="336" />
<ol start="3">
 	<li>Fasten with 6d finish nails, the top nail into a stud, the bottom nail into the sole plate. Pre-drill.</li>
 	<li>Cope adjacent pieces with jig or coping saw and test fit. File as necessary to get tight joint.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1024" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/finish-trim-baseboard-3-4.jpg" alt="" width="681" height="337" />
<ol start="5">
 	<li>Mark cut for butt joint with coped end tightly in place. Add 1/16" extra and cut to length.</li>
 	<li>Bow baseboard slightly and fot ends, then push against wall. This clamps coped joint tightly. Nail.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/finish-trim-baseboard-5-6.jpg" alt="" width="677" height="351" />

Then, when cutting and laying pieces out, select the most attractive for the most visible spots. Hide the worst in the closet. If possible, use the same piece to “wrap” highly visible comers, so that the grain pattern continues right on through the miter. If you have to splice, select pieces with similar grain and color so the splice will not be noticed.

Begin installation with the most exacting pieces, the outside miters. Progress toward the easiest, the butt joints at the doors. Nail at the top into each stud (it helps to locate and mark these in advance) and at the bottom into the sole plate.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Like the mythical Phoenix rising from the ashes, glass block has recently climbed back into fashion again after being consigned to art-deco diners and industrial windows for many years.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1047" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/glass-block-shower-924x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="617" />

Its comeback makes good sense, as you can see in this shower. This challenging project shows how practical, yet attractive, glass block can be. When mortared, it makes strong walls that are impervious to water and easy to maintain. Since you can buy glass block in a variety of sizes and shapes, you can custom ﬁt a shower into almost any bathroom. And of course, the transparent glass makes the shower less prominent, brightens shadowy corners. and adds a pleasant sparkle to the room.
<h2>Step-by-step process</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>Outline the shower design on the walls and ﬂoor, remove the wall covering, and ﬁt the shower base to locate the drain. Trial fit blocks to check measurements.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1035" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/glass-block-shower-01.jpg" alt="" width="671" height="503" />
<ol start="2">
 	<li>Double the ﬂoor ioists under glass block wall when plumbing the drain lines. Add 2x support blocks where glass block wall parallels joists.</li>
 	<li>Insert two straight studs into the wall, make them perfectly vertical with a level, and nail them to the top and bottom plates.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/glass-block-shower-02-03.jpg" alt="" width="738" height="372" />
<ol start="4">
 	<li>Build a form (painted yellow and red here) to mold the concrete sill around the base. Make the top even with the base top and level.</li>
 	<li>Lift the shower base and spread a thick asphalt layer over the top of the dried concrete sill. Then reset the shower base.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1037" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/glass-block-shower-04-05.jpg" alt="" width="738" height="369" />
<ol start="6">
 	<li>Stack the blocks using shims and spacers to check their fit. Mark the row heights, then continue the marks up the wall at 8” intervals to guide the other rows.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1038" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/glass-block-shower-06.jpg" alt="" width="822" height="643" />
<ol start="7">
 	<li>Nail a top plate to the ceiling joists 1/2" above the top mark. The plate should be positioned directly above the concrete sill below.</li>
 	<li>Lay a mortar bed on the sill, and set the first row of blocks. Begin with the corner and use spacers and shims to level the first row. Let set two hours.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1039" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/glass-block-shower-07-08.jpg" alt="" width="738" height="370" />
<ol start="9">
 	<li>Mix more mortar and fill the first row joints, using a piece of wire reinforcement to make sure the joints completely fill.</li>
 	<li>Spread another bed of mortar over the ﬁrst row and lay wire reinforcement into it. Repeat every other row. The spacers remain in place.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1040" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/glass-block-shower-09-10.jpg" alt="" width="743" height="369" />
<ol start="11">
 	<li>Butter the side of each set block and press the next block against it so mortar squeezes out and it fits tightly against the plastic spacers.</li>
 	<li>Set the corner block last. Spacers don’t fit it, so be sure that it’s level and plumb. Adjust the entire row to fit the corner correctly, it necessary.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1041" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/glass-block-shower-11-12.jpg" alt="" width="729" height="369" />
<ol start="13">
 	<li>Fasten a steel anchor to the studs with two screws before adding the third row. Mortar hides the anchor. Repeat every other raw.</li>
 	<li>Tap blocks with a trowel handle to adjust them. Use a straight edge that reaches from the concrete sill to the top plate to keep them plumb.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1042" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/glass-block-shower-13-14.jpg" alt="" width="836" height="375" />
<ol start="15">
 	<li>Fill the concave sides of blocks along edges so the mortar color shows through the block. Attach anchors between every other block in top row.</li>
 	<li>Pack mortar in joints when it stiffens but before it hardens with a concave striking tool. Break off spacer ends and smooth the joints.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1043" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/glass-block-shower-15-16.jpg" alt="" width="738" height="373" />
<ol start="17">
 	<li>Brush off remaining lumps of mortar, then buff block faces with a dry towel. Scrub off stubborn residue with an abrasive pad.</li>
 	<li>Caulk the gaps at the top and sides with silicone caulk, after gluing tile to top plate. Limit joint width to 1/4" maximum in width and depth.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1044" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/glass-block-shower-17-18.jpg" alt="" width="737" height="369" />
<h2>Factors to consider</h2>
While there’s virtually no limit to the imaginative use of glass block in a shower, two factors kept us down to earth — our shower had to be simple and water-tight.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1045" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/glass-block-shower-wall-details-841x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="678" />

To make sure we avoided leaks, we bought a molded ﬁberglass shower base (available from home centers or plumbing ﬁxture suppliers) for our pan (shower ﬂoor). They come in several sizes, so choose the one that best ﬁts your plan. The other good, though more complicated, option for a leak-proof shower is to build a custom pan using a special liner, concrete and tile. This takes longer and it is not our main topic today.

This project uses two types of specialty glass block — the attractive comer block for the 90-degree angle and the end block for one side of the doorway. Comer block comes in both 6” and 8” sizes, though only in clear and wavy styles.

End block comes only in the 8” size, so the rest of the wall uses 8” x 8” blocks, because you can't mix the 6” and 8” sizes if you want your mortar lines to align. The end blocks limits choices in another way. They’re 3-7/8” thick, the larger of the two standard thicknesses. So the entire project uses 3-7/ 8” thick blocks. The slimmer size (3-1/2” thick) would be better to lighten the wall

As you can see. juggling all these glass block options can get complicated, depending upon your project design. To help plan, visit a glass block dealer and examine the sizes and styles you have to work with. That might also inﬂuence what size shower base you buy.
<h2>Getting started</h2>
Without a doubt, building a custom shower is a big, expensive project. You need to buy glass block, base, tile, plumbing materials, etc).

A professional would need about ﬁve days to complete all the steps, including plumbing and framing, concrete work, glass block laying, and tile setting. So allow yourself at least 10 days if you decide to do it all yourself. of course, you can hire pros for parts you don't want to mess with or to speed the project up. <strong>This is not a project for a novice. </strong>

You might have to adapt your ﬁberglass shower base slightly to provide good watertight support for your glass block walls. You can cut off the front edge with a jigsaw, so you can support the front with the concrete sill and waterproof it better. Waterprooﬁng is the main principle to keep in mind when you modify a base. Leaks will cause the wood ﬂoor to rot and ruin the shower.

Another critical detail is to match the shower base size to the length of the glass block walls. In this design, four 8” blocks along one side (blocks measure 7-3/4 in, mortar joints 1/4 in.) plus a corner block added up to 34” on the inside (38 in, outside, Fig. 1).

As a rule, leave 1/2-in. expansion space between the block and the studs, making the inside 34-1/2 in. wide. The base was only 34 in. wide. To solve the problem and to keep the shower waterproof, slid the base 1 in. out from the back wall studs so the outer glass-block wall lapped over its edge. later. Screw 1-in. tuning strips to the back wall studs before adding backer board and tile.

A ﬁnal critical detail is to make sure your ﬂoor is strong enough. Each glass block weighs 6 lbs., so the weight adds up fast. A standard 4-in. concrete ﬂoor would support our shower, but most wooden ﬂoors won‘t unless they‘re reinforced.

You don't have to double every ﬂoor joist (Photo 2), but for a wall this size, double at least two, those that support the most weight. Consult your local building inspector on this point to make sure you provide enough support.

Otherwise your ﬂoor will sag or bounce too much and cause the walls to crack or leak.

You have to open the ﬂoor up anyway to run drains and water lines, so this is a good time to add joists. Each new joist should be as long as the one it doubles, so you’re sure it has a strong support point on either end. Sometimes they won‘t ﬁt easily because of pipes, electrical wiring or other obstructions. Consult your building inspector or a professional carpenter for help if you need it.

Also notice the reinforcement of the ﬂoor with 2x10 blocks spaced 16 in. apart (Photo 2). Since the outer shower wall runs between two joists, the blocks directly support the wall above and keep the plywood floor from sagging.
<h2>Preparing the concrete sill</h2>
The sill extends along two sides of the shower and supports the glass block and edge of the ﬁberglass base. This project favored a concrete sill as opposed to a wood sill because water won’t cause the concrete to swell and open gaps like wood, should the sill get wet. You can also mold concrete easily around the shower base.

Build your concrete sill forms from 2x material and nail them to the wood floor, leveling them with the top edge of the shower base, even if the floor dips (Photo 4).

Then put a piece of plastic inside the form to keep moisture out of the ﬂoor, and pack the forms with concrete. For this job, buy concrete mix in sacks from a home center and mix it with enough water to thoroughly wet it without making it ninny or sloppy.

Be sure the concrete doesn’t lift the shower pan as you pack it Then cover it with plastic and let it harden for two days.

At that time, you can lift the pan out, spread a thick layer of asphalt (roof patching material) on the top of the concrete, and reset the pan, embedding it in the asphalt (Photo 5).

When the asphalt is dry to the touch, you’re ready to lay the glass blocks.
<h2>Laying glass block</h2>
Until a few years ago when Pittsburgh-Coming began marketing plastic spacers, only experts could build a project this large. Plastic spacers are incredibly cheap and now make it easier. The spacers align the block faces and maintain 1/4-in, mortar joint spacing as you squeeze the blocks together.

Still, laying glass block requires patience and attention to detail. To keep the walls going perfectly straight, they were built inside a rigid frame with three perfect sides. One side is the level sill. The second is a pair of studs nailed perfectly vertical in the wall (Photo 3 and Fig. 1C). The metal edge nailed over the drywall (Photo 6 inset) is also vertical, so it too acts as a guide.

To ﬁnd the third side of the frame, the top, stack the ﬁrst two rows of blocks without mortar, spacing the bottom with shims and other rows with plastic spacers (Photo 6). Notice that you can’t use spacers with the corner blocks. You'll lay these freehand or with shims. Mark the heights of the ﬁrst two rows, then continue marking on up the wall at 8-in. intervals. These represent the height of each successive row. Install a wood top plate on the ceiling 1/2 in. above the ﬁnal 8-in. mark
(Photo 7 and Fig. 1B).

This leaves enough room for the top row plus a gap in case the ceiling sags. Make sure the plate lies directly above the sill beneath, using a long straight edge and level or a plumb bob (weight on a string). Later you'll reuse the straight edge that spans from the sill to the top plate to make sure the blocks stay vertical.
<h2>Setting the first row of glass blocks</h2>
The following description of glass-block-laying technique will help your wall go up smoothly.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1046" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/glass-block-shower-wall-diy.jpg" alt="" width="428" height="391" />

As you read, note the tools (available at complete hardware or building centers) and special materials used — white mortar, reinforcing wire, metal anchors, and expansion strips (available from glass block dealers).
<h3>Step One</h3>
Prepare about 1/3 of a 50-lb. sack of mortar for the ﬁrst row, mixing it to a soft, sticky pudding consistency. The mortar should stick to your trowel. Use the white, prepackaged mortar mix ﬁ-om a glass block dealer, because the white shows through the insides of the blocks and brightens the wall.

Spread a 1/2 in. layer of mortar on the sill and set your ﬁrst row, beginning with the comer (Photo 8). Tap the blocks down into the mortar with the handle of your trowel. and make them all perfectly level with your ﬁrst wall mark, using wood shims beneath and spacers above.

Laying the first row accurately isn‘t easy, so take your time.

Then scrape off the excess mortar and let the blocks sit until the mortar stiffens, about one to two hours. You want these ﬁrst blocks to stay anchored and give you a good starting point
<h3>Step Two</h3>
Mix another batch of mortar, the remaining 2/3 sack, and ﬁll the ﬁrst row joints (Photo 9). Then, with the spacers in place, lay a mortar bed for the second row.

Before laying this row, cut special wire reinforcement for the full length of the row with wire cutters and lay it into the bed (Photo 10). Use this wire every second row as you build.

Then lay the blocks, this time buttering (mason’s term for spreading mortar) the vertical edge of each one before laying the next against it (Photo 11).

Add a spacer to the top, and tap the blocks together and down to seat them on the spacers. Set the comer block last from now on (Photo 12).
<h3>Step Three</h3>
Before laying the third row, fasten a special metal anchor to the studs with two 1-1/4 in. screws (Photo 13 and Fig. 1C). Use these every other row, alternating with the wire. Also install them between every second block at the top (Photo 15).

<strong>Laying a glass block wall isn‘t quite as effortless as the photos make it look, even with the plastic spacers.</strong> You'll need patience and a good 2 or 4-ft. level to make sure each row rises evenly. A straight edge that spans from the sill to the plate (Photo 14) helps, too, because it keeps the wall perfectly vertical.

For best results, I recommend that you lay half the rows on one day and the last half on a second day. This gives the mortar in your ﬁrst section time to harden, and makes the wall more stable as you climb a ladder to lay higher blocks. Besides. there's more to do.
<h3>Step Four</h3>
By the time you get to the fourth or ﬁfth row, the mortar will begin to set in lower rows, and you'll need to go back and shape the mortar joints before they harden.

First, break off the ends of the plastic spacers. by grasping them with a wire cutter or pliers and twisting. Then ﬁll the holes and pack and smooth the joints with a special 1/2-in. concave “striking” tool (Photo 16).

After striking the joints, brush excess mortar off the blocks with a soft brush, then buff off the cement residue with a towel.

You'll ﬁnd the mortar already beginning to dry on the block faces by this time. But you can't scrub too hard yet since you could break a block loose. Use a dry, non-metallic abrasive pad.
<h3>Step Five</h3>
After letting the ﬁrst section harden overnight, continue on to the top. Use metal anchors at the top, too (Photo 15). These anchors are the only solid connections you make to the ceiling and wall. They’ll ﬂex slightly so the rigid glass block wall can “ﬂoat,” that is, move as the wood ﬂoor dips slightly when you walk across it.

The soft, plastic expansion strip (Figs. 13 and 1C) maintains a 1/2-in. ﬂexible gap separating the wall and ceiling from the glass block.
<h3>Step Six</h3>
Since the joints at the wall and ceiling will move slightly, they'll crack if you mortar or grout them. Rather, use silicone caulk to ﬁll the crack where the block meets the wall, both inside and outside the shower. Also glue tile to the top plate (Fig. 1B) and caulk the remaining gap between the block and the tile.
<h3>Step Seven</h3>
Finally, to make cleaning easier, seal the mortar joints on the inside after giving them about a week to dry. You can use the same sealer you used for the tile grout (available from tile dealers).]]></content:encoded>

		<title>How to install a frost free Sillcock Outdoor Faucet</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's Saturday morning. and if you’re like me, it's time to give the family cars their weekly washing. Let's see now. The cars are parked in the driveway in front, and the outdoor faucet’s in back. So once again, it's time to drag the hose (three 50-ft. sections!) through the shrubbery to get the water to the cars.

But today, instead of washing those cars, why not take the time to move the outside water supply closer to where you need it by installing an additional outdoor faucet?

The materials are cheap and even if your plumbing skills are only average, you can do the job in just a few hours.
<h2>List of steps</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>Install the outdoor faucet (sill cock). Place the angled siding wedge between the sill cock and siding. The wedge helps ensure the downward pitch for draining.</li>
 	<li>Apply a liberal amount of flux to the ends of the pipe and to the insides of the fittings. Clean the pipe ends and the insides of the fittings with emery cloth before applying flux.</li>
 	<li>Connect the fittings to all of the sections of the new pipe. Put the pieces into position to make sure that the new sections of pipe are the correct length.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1051" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/install-frost-free-sillcock-outdoor-faucet-1-2-3-1024x343.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="187" />
<ol start="4">
 	<li>Align the center of the copper tee with the centering mark on the cold water pipe. Measure back 1/2 in. from both ends of the tee and mark these spots on the cold water pipe.</li>
 	<li>Cut out the short section of pipe (about 1-1/2 in.) with a pipe cutter. Keep a bucket and rags close by. Dry pipe ends thoroughly. Clean the cut pipe ends and apply flux.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1052" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/install-frost-free-sillcock-outdoor-faucet-4-5.jpg" alt="" width="876" height="527" />
<ol start="6">
 	<li>Install the tee between the cold water pipes. Assemble the remaining section of pipe. Make sun the faucet is angled downward to the outside before you solder.</li>
 	<li>Solder all the joints with lead-free solder. Make sure the sill cock is open so pressure doesn’t build up and so the internal rubber washers don’t burn.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1053" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/install-frost-free-sillcock-outdoor-faucet-6-7.jpg" alt="" width="879" height="482" />
<h2>Here’s what you’ll need</h2>
The most obvious item is a freeze-proof, anti-siphon outdoor faucet (sill cock), available from better hardware stores, home centers or plumbing supply dealers.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1050" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/install-frost-free-sillcock-outdoor-faucet-1024x536.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="292" />

The freeze-proof design means that you don’t need to shut off the outside water supply in the winter. The shut-off mechanism of the faucet is located at the end of the copper water tube (see photo inset), not inside the faucet itself.

The anti-siphon device, which prevents any contaminated water from being siphoned back into the potable (human consumption) water supply, is required by many plumbing codes.
<h3>You’ll also need to purchase</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>3/4-in. inside diameter (i.d.) rigid copper water pipe (usually sold in 10-ft. lengths);</li>
 	<li>90- and 45-degree-angle copper elbows (the exact number depends on your installation);</li>
 	<li>pipe hanging devices, needed every 5-6 ft. for 3/4-in. pipe (again, the exact number will depend on your installation);</li>
 	<li>lead-free solder (required by code for soldered joints for a potable water supply line);</li>
 	<li>flux (a paste that’s applied to the copper pipe and fittings to ensure that the solder fuses to the copper);</li>
 	<li>a pipe cutter;</li>
 	<li>emery cloth (a black sanding cloth);</li>
 	<li>and a propane torch.</li>
</ul>
If your home plumbing system’s pipe is a material other than copper, such as galvanized or plastic, you’ll need to buy an adapter or reducer to connect a freeze-proof sill cock.
<h2>Determine the location</h2>
Where you would like to put a new sill cock and where you can actually do so don’t always agree. Obstacles, both outside and inside the house, will be factors.

The best way to determine where to install the sill cock is to look for penetration points where objects such as electrical service cables, telephone lines or air conditioning pipes enter the house.

By locating these spots and installing the sill cock near one of them, you’ll usually encounter the least amount of resistance getting through your home's siding and foundation
<h2>Check out the interior</h2>
Once you've located where you’d like to install the sill cock on the outside of the house, go inside and locate where that spot will enter If you ﬁnd, for example, that where you want to install the faucet means cutting into a ﬁnished basement ceiling, you’ll want to pick a different spot. Or you may decide it‘s time to call in a plumber.

Also, check out what type of material you'll need to go through. If, for example, you have to drill through a concrete wall, you'll probably want to ﬁnd an easier installation spot.

Whenever possible, try to penetrate the wood rim joist— the board that's perpendicular to the concrete block and wraps around the entire length of your house, separating the basement block from the wall framing lumber — of the house. it's the easiest of the materials to drill through and usually doesn't require buying or renting any special tools or accessories.
<h2>Planning the pipe route</h2>
The new supply line's inside diameter should be 3/ 4 in., which means tying into the 3/4-in. main water line. You should never tie into a smaller diameter water line, or there won‘t be enough water pressure. Because of this, you may need to install substantial lengths of pipe to reach the 3/4-in. service line.

If it‘s impossible to access the main water Line, you can install a sill cock with a 1/2-in. i.d., if your local plumbing code permits. Most manufacturers make both sizes.
<h2>Work backwards</h2>
With this project, you start outside the house and work back to the cold water line. This will ensure that the installation point on your home‘s exterior is not located on a siding joint, or “lap.” Also, the sill cock must be installed at a slight downward angle so that the water drains after it’s shut off.

If your house has wood or Masonite siding. you can drill through the siding and rim joist with a 7/ 8-in. spade bit. If you’re drilling through concrete, you’ll need a hammer drill with a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/best-drill-bit-set/">good masonry bit</a>.

Once the exterior surface and rim joist have been penetrated, set the sill cock in the hole and position the angled siding wedge, usually included with the sill cock. between the sill cock and the siding (Photo 1). Secure the sill cock to the house with the recommended fasteners, usually brass or galvanized wood screws.

Open the sill cock fully (turn handle counterclockwise) as if you were going to run water through it. That way, when you solder the joints. the faucet's internal rubber washers won’t burn and pressure won’t build up from the expanding hot air.
<h2>Measure and assemble</h2>
No two installations will be identical, since obstacles and installation points will vary. But you can follow these basic steps and adjust them as needed.

Once the sill cock is in place, measure the distance from the end of the sill cock to the cold water line. Add an additional 3/4 in. for the soldered connection into the sill cock.

To determine which pipe is the cold water pipe, turn on a couple of hot water taps inside the house. Then feel both water pipes to see which is cooler.

Cut the necessary lengths of pipe, both vertical and horizontal pieces, with a pipe cutter.

Clean the ends of the pipe and the insides of any elbows or other connecting ﬁttings with emery cloth.

Apply flux to the cleaned pipe ends (Photo 2), the insides of the ﬁttings and the inside connecting area of the sill cock. Assemble the pipe sections and ﬁttings (Photo 3).

The only pipe and ﬁtting that isn't prepared, at this point is the existing
cold water line and new connecting tee. You’ll clean and apply ﬂux to these after you turn off the water and cut into the pipe.
<h2>Cutting to the existing line</h2>
There are still a couple of things you need to do before you shut off the water.

To make sure the new copper pipe is installed at a 90-degree angle to the existing cold water pipe, measure from the inside edge of the floor joist that's closest to the sill cock, to the center of the sill cock‘s connecting end. Then, mark this distance from the inside of the same floor joist onto the cold water pipe (Photo 4)

Next, center the copper tee to the centering mark Measure about 1/2 in. in from both ends of the tee. Mark these spots on the cold water pipe (Photo 4). The section of pipe (about 1-1/2 in.) between the two marks will be cut out and replaced by the tee.

Now shut off the water at the water meter.

Before cutting into the main line, open the cold water tap that's at the lowest point in the plumbing system. for example on the basement sink or laundry tub. This will drain as much water as possible from the cold water line.

Cut out the section of cold water pipe using the pipe cutter (Photo 5) Keep a bucket and some rags handy to catch the water that will drain.

You may ﬁnd that the hot and cold water pipes are so close together that you can’t turn the pipe cutter 360 degrees. If this happens, cut the cold water pipe with a hacksaw.

Dry the pipe as much as possible before cleaning the ends with emery cloth and applying ﬂux. The drier you can keep the pipe. the better the soldered joint.

Here's a trick for keeping the pipe ends dry: Stuff a ball of white bread into both ends of the cut pipe. The bread will absorb any remaining water and will be completely flushed out when the water is turned back on. The bread won't plug or harm the system.

Clean off the ends of the cut cold water line and apply flux. Also, clean and apply ﬂux inside all three ends of the tee.

Install the tee between the cold water pipe sections and connect the short vertical pipe into the tee (Photo 6).

Solder all of the joints with lead-free solder (Photo 7).

After you ﬁnish soldering, turn the water back on and check for leaking joints.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Consumer Vs. Pro Power Tools</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/consumer-vs-pro-power-tools.jpg" alt="" width="709" height="621" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1056" />

If you're getting more involved in <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/">home improvement</a> projects, you might be thinking about buying tools like a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-circular-saw/">circular saw</a>, jigsaw and several other power tools.

You might have heard from more experienced people, even tradesmen, who will advise, "Buy the best tool you can afford."

You might do that — spend hundreds of dollars on professional-grade power tools — but the question always remains: are they really worth the extra money?

The answer is no, it isn’t always worth buying the best power tool you can afford. Sometimes, yes — mostly, no.

A <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-drill-driver-kit/">top-quality professional-grade cordless drill</a> is a good investment. You'll use a drill all your life, and since it's very easy to push a drill to its limit, you'll appreciate the extra power and durability of a pro tool. Drilling masonry, for instance, can severely damage a light-weight drill.

For other power tools, though, you’ll generally do ﬁne with a top-of-the-line consumer tool. Take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_saw">circular saws</a>, for example. A good consumer tool will have all the power you'll need and cut just as well as a pro model — quality of cut being mainly in the blade, after all. Furthermore, professional circular saws are quite a bit heavier and they lack the safety switch commonly found on consumer saws.

A <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/can-you-cut-plywood-with-a-jigsaw/">jig saw</a> just doesn't get used much, and when you do use it, you aren't likely to overload it. Save your money on this tool.

With sanders and routers, it’s a tossup. They don't normally get used enough in home improvement projects to make it worthwhile buying expensive professional models. Get a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/benchtop-jointer/">good consumer-grade tool</a> and you'll do ﬁne. If you intend to do a fair amount of <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/new-hobby-woodworking/">woodworking</a>, however, a larger, professional-grade router will allow you to do much more, and a pro-grade belt sander will give you much better results on delicate work.

Finally, it’s just a good rule not to buy more tool than you need. When you're ready to move up to a bigger or better tool, do it then.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A beginner’s guide on how to patch a carpet (with pictures)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Food, mud, pets, ink, kids, burns, coffee, bubble gum, nail polish — let me count the ways we have of ruining our carpets. Many stains can be removed with spot removers, shampoos or rinses (and surely, the sooner you deal with a stain, the better your chances of removing it)

But when those methods fail, your choices are to live with the damage, move the couch on top of it. Replace the whole carpet — or patch it.

<h2>Materials</h2>

All it takes to patch a carpet is a carpenter's square, sharp utility knife and double-faced tape (all available at home centers) and about a half hour of your time.

Cut your replacement patch from a spare piece of carpet or from an inconspicuous spot, like the back of a closet as in the pictures below.

<h2>How to patch a carpet</h2>

<ol>
<li>Cut out and remove the damaged section of the carpet. Before cutting, separate the threads or "nap" of the carpet (as shown in the inset photo) so you can cut through the carpet backing without cutting off a lot of threads along the edge. The more threads that remain intact along the edge, the easier it will be to blend the finished patch.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>Cut a replacement patch using the damaged piece you just removed as a pattern. Cut this from a spare piece of carpet or from an inconspicuous place such as the back of a closet as shown in the picture. Patch this hole with the damaged piece of carpet.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li>Apply double-faced carpet tape around the perimeter of the hole. Press the tape into position on the floor, then peel back and remove the special backing on the top of the tape.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li>Press the new patch in place. Use a rolling pin or weigh it down with heavy items for a few hours. Finally, use your hand to brush the na along the seam to help blend the patch.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Final tips</h2>

If your carpet has a pattern or special weave to it, try to match it when you cut your patch.

This repair works well for rubber-backed carpet, indoor-outdoor carpet, or any carpet without a separate pad beneath.

You can patch a carpet with a separate pad in much the same way, but you need a different type of tape and a special iron to melt the glue on the tape — it’s a task you may want to consider hiring a professional to do.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>How do I fix doors that are out of plumb?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In older homes, often some doors just move by themselves. Some doors. if you open them, gradually close by themselves, while others open gradually after they are closed. How can you ﬁx this?

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1065" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/how-to-fix-doors-out-of-plumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="607" height="603" />

Don't call the exorcist, because it sounds like your house has just settled a bit with age. This has caused some of the door frames to be out of plumb; that is. the hinges are no longer in line with each other. There’s a “quick and dirty” ﬁx, and an elaborate but long-lasting one. Take your pick, but we’d try the quick one ﬁrst.

<strong>The quick and dirty ﬁx is to remove each hinge pin (the rod that holds the two hinge leaves together), one at a time, and whack it with a hammer. You want the pin to be bent slightly, so the hinges are stiff enough to prevent the door from swinging by itself. A more permanent ﬁx is to re-hang the door so it’s plumb. Keep on reading after the illustration for details.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1066" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/how-to-fix-doors-out-of-plumb-2.jpg" alt="" width="406" height="736" />

The first step is to take the door off its hinges. Then use a level to see in which direction the door frame is crooked: parallel with the wall, perpendicular to it, or both.

Use a 6-ft. level if you can get a hold of one, or a shorter level held securely against a very straight board. Place your level against the barrels (the round part) of the hinges for checking perpendicular to the wall, and against the leaves (the flat part) of the hinges to check parallel to the wall.

If the hinges are out of plumb parallel to the wall, slip a shim under the hinge that needs it. You can use pieces of cardboard, metal ﬂashing or a thin strip of wood.

If the hinges are out of plumb perpendicular to the wall, one of them will have to be moved sideways. You may need to chisel out the hinge recess to enlarge it, and you may also need to remove the door stop and reposition it alter you install the door.

If you're moving the hinge only a small amount, the screws may insist on going back into the old holes. In this case, drill out the screw holes to 3/16 in., glue in pieces of dowel using ﬁve-minute epoxy glue. And trim the dowels ﬂush. Now you should be able to get the screws to go in where you want them.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>How To Repair Small Drywall Holes (with pictures)</title>
		<link>http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/repair-drywall-holes/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What do a doorknob, the furniture movers, and your teenager's foot have in common? How about the uncanny ability to put baseball-size holes in your <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/hang-drywall-by-yourself/">drywall</a>?

Fortunately, repairing the damage is easy.
<h2>Tools needed</h2>
If your tool assortment is limited, use a utility knife instead of a drywall saw to cut away the damaged area and a standard Phillips screw-driver (and wrist power) instead of the <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/best-cordless-drill/">cordless drill</a>.
<h2>Repair instructions</h2>
Enlarge and square up the hole as the pictures show, rather than trying to cut a patch the exact shape of the damaged area. If you encounter a 2x4 stud close to the edge of the hole, cut the damaged wallboard back to the center of the stud and secure one edge of your patch to that. Otherwise, secure the patch with backer boards as we show.
<ol>
 	<li>Cut and remove the damaged section of drywall. Squaring up and enlarging the area will make it easier to patch and repair.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1082" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/how-to-repair-drywall-1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="354" />
<ol start="2">
 	<li>Slip backer boards into the hole.</li>
 	<li>Secure them in place using 1-1/4 in. drywall screws while you hold them from the back.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1083" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/how-to-repair-drywall-2.jpg" alt="" width="808" height="548" />
<ol start="4">
 	<li>Install the patch, then secure it in place with drywall screws. Cut patch a bit undersized to allow for a 1/8-in. gap around all four edges.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
 	<li>Finish repair by covering the seams with self-sticking fiberglass tape, then three thin coats of joint compound. Allow the compound to dry; sand smooth between each coat.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1085" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/how-to-repair-drywall-4.jpg" alt="" width="544" height="416" />
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Apply fiberglass drywall tape and a thin coat of joint compound, let it dry, then lightly sand the area with fine-grit sandpaper. Apply two more coats of compound. gradually broadening the area and sanding until the patch blends with the existing wall.</li>
 	<li>Holes smaller than 2 in. across can be repaired by placing fiberglass tape across the opening, then applying two or three coats of joint compound. For damaged areas larger than 8 in., cut the drywall back to the middle of the studs on each side of the hole. then cut and secure a patch directly to the studs.</li>
 	<li>If the hole was caused by a door, prevent future damage by installing a spring bumper on the baseboard.</li>

 	<li><strong>add smart cabinet storage to create convenience.</strong></li>
</ul>
Keep on reading for all the details.
<h2>Replacing a kitchen countertop and sink</h2>
Most people, in fact, never totally replace their kitchen. More often they replace countertop and sink, perhaps an appliance or two, rejuvenate the cabinets, put down a new floor, paper walls, and get a whole new look for a fraction of a entirely new kitchen.

For a do-it-yourselfer, replacing the sink and countertop is probably the toughest part of the lob. The first section of this article provides step-by-step guidance.

Also tricky is putting a really respectable new finish on your existing cabinets. Patience is the watchword here; we give you helpful tips on painting, refinishing or resurfacing your cabinets, along with other kitchen facelifting ideas.
<h3>Buying a new countertop</h3>
Most home centers sell new countertops like the one shown on the following photos. They come with corners already mitered, and provisions for connecting these miters with fasteners. You can buy standard-size counter sections right off the floor, but you will find a limited choice of colors, and you’ll have to cut the countertop yourself to the necessary lengths and apply end caps.

However, most home centers will also order custom-made countertops, or provide you with the name of a local fabricating shop. Though more expensive, a custom countertop comes in the exact size you need and offers a choice from among many dozens of colors and patterns. For a custom-made countertop you can expect to wait about 10 days for delivery and pay twice as much as a ready-made countertop per linear ft.

Along with replacing your countertop, you'll very likely replace your sink and faucet. If you plan to switch to a larger size sink, make sure the cabinet below will accommodate the width.
<h4>Measuring for a countertop</h4>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kitchen-revival-measuring-for-a-countertop.jpg" alt="" width="658" height="505" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1088" />

Don’t get caught bringing home a new countertop that’s the wrong size; it’s a mistake you won’t forget, especially if your countertop is custom made. Measure everything twice. Make a sketch, with dimensions, and make sure the sketch stays with your order.

For an L-shaped top measure from the corner to the ends of each arm. Allow the top to overhang the cabinets 1 in. at the free end of an arm, and 1/8 in. where the end abuts a range or refrigerator; these ends should have finished laminate end caps, and these finished ends should be indicated on your sketch. Ends abutting a wall, like the left end in the illustration, should be flush with the side of the base cabinet.
<h3>How to remove old kitchen countertop</h3>
Countertops are secured to the base cabinets by screws driven from below. After you have found all these screws and removed them, disconnect the sink from its drain and water lines.

With a helper, you can probably pick up sink and countertop together and get rid of it in one piece.

If it’s too large or too heavy for this, simply cut the countertop into manageable pieces with a jig saw. Be careful not to cut into the base cabinets, and don't damage the wall cabinets while removing the countertop and sink.
<h3>Preparing the base cabinets</h3>
After the old countertop is off, check the base cabinets for level. Unless your old countertop was very much askew, there should be very few, if any, out-of-level areas. Fill unlevel spots along the base cabinet tops with shims —glued and tacked in place about 12 in. apart. You probably shouldn’t try to re-level any of the cabinets themselves; this could easily turn into a nightmare.

Check especially the level of any counter-supporting cleats that are screwed to the wall where there is no cabinet support, such as behind a dishwasher or in a comer. The cleat itself should be level, and exactly aligned with the tops of the base cabinets along their back edge.
<h3>How to fit and install the new kitchen counter</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>Check level of base cabinets, front to back, end to end. and diagonally. Level cabinet tops with shims glued and tacked about 12 in. apart.</li>
 	<li>Level cleats on the wall behind dishwasher, or where there are no cabinets to support the top. Secure cleat to the studs with screws.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
 	<li>Cut corner off the overhanging laminate at rear of the miter for maneuvering room when fitting counter between walls. Reglue later.</li>
 	<li>Slide counter sections in place for preliminary fit. Check overhang in all areas for indications where trimming or scribing are required.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
 	<li>Fit counter end against an uneven wall; scribe with a pencil to the wall's contour. If the gap is very wide, hold a shim behind the pencil.</li>
 	<li>Cut scribed counter end with a jigsaw. For an accurate fit cut at a slight angle to the surface so just the laminate edge abuts the wall.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="7">
 	<li>Scribe the plastic laminate that overhangs the rear of the backsplash to accommodate any serious irregularity in the walls.</li>
 	<li>Trim the laminate to the contour of the wall using a tile or a belt sander, following the marked line; keep the cutting force downward.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="9">
 	<li>Mark sink location around sink perimeter; make sure counter is properly positioned (but not secured) and that sink is centered.</li>
 	<li>Cut the sink hole with a jigsaw along a line setback from the sink perimeter line. Instructions with sink should specify setback distance.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="11">
 	<li>Cut on the underside of the counter for back line of sink hole if your saw will not fit along the backsplash on the top surface.</li>
 	<li>Glue miter joint with wood glue; then, before glue dries, secure with the fasteners that come with the top. Do a dry run first without glue.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="13">
 	<li>Tighten fasteners from below, with top pulled away from the wall. If the counter is small enough, turn it upside down to make the joint.</li>
 	<li>Secure countertop to cabinets with screws through cabinet corner blocks. Make sure screws will not come through the counter surface.</li>
</ol>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kitchen-revival-replacing-a-countertop-and-sink-13-14.jpg" alt="" width="732" height="338" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1095" />

<ol start="15">
 	<li>Spread adhesive caulk in a consistent bead around the sink opening where the sinks contact area will rest on the counter.</li>
 	<li>Drop sink in place, and slide into exact position. Smooth caulk with thumb, wipe with damp cloth. Placing fitting on sink first is easier.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="17">
 	<li>Hook up plumbing, first hot and cold lines, then drain lines. If sink is in same place as before, cut new drain pieces same size as old ones.</li>
</ol>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kitchen-revival-replacing-a-countertop-and-sink-17-wide.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="336" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097" />

<ol start="18">
 	<li>Cut countertop section to length if necessary, using sharp blade and clamped-on saw guide. Cut backsplash from backside.</li>
 	<li>Apply end cap with contact cement after building up the countertop end to full 1-1/2 in. thickness with a cleat glued and tacked in place.</li>
</ol>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kitchen-revival-replacing-a-countertop-and-sink-18-19.jpg" alt="" width="709" height="263" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1098" />

After the old countertop is gone and the cabinet top is leveled, lay the new countertop sections in place to check the overall fit. If a section must slide in place between two walls, give yourself a little play by neatly clipping off a corner of the overhanging laminate at the rear of the miter, as shown in the photos. You can glue this piece back on after the installation is completed.

Check the fit where the ends of the countertop and backsplash abut walls. Mark and trim them to fit as shown. To cut a countertop end, use a jig saw, held at a slight angle so as to bevel back the particle board slightly. This will help you make a neater fit.

Most backsplashes are made so the plastic laminate overhangs the top edge of the backsplash about 1/4 in. to make it easier to scribe, or contour, to an uneven wall. You can use a file to do this, as shown, or a belt sander, but make sure the cutting action is always downward so as to avoid chipping.

After the counter is accurately positioned, lay the sink in place, upside down. Center it on the window and/or the cabinet below, and trace its outline. The actual cutout line must be marked inside this outline, anywhere from 1/4 in. to 1 in., depending on the type of sink you are using. Follow the instructions that come with the sink.

Cut the sink hole before you join the miter or secure the countertop to the cabinets. You may find it necessary to cut the rear line for the sink hole from the underside of the countertop if the shoe of your jigsaw is too wide to run between the line and the backsplash.

When you buy a countertop with a mitered comer, the screw-tight joint fasteners, like those shown in the picture, are supplied, and the recesses for these fasteners will have been cut into the bottom of the countertop. The miter joint must be glued with wood glue. You will have to work speedily to get the joint snugged up before the glue sets, so do a complete dry run first.

Secure the top to the cabinets after the sink hole is cut; mount the sink following the manufacturer's instructions.
<h3>Counter end caps</h3>
A custom-made countertop will come with its ends already finished, However, if you decide to buy your countertop in standardized ready-made sections you will have to cut the ends to length, then apply the end caps.

With a very sharp blade in your circular saw you can cut the countertop from the top side, using a clamped-in-place guide, as shown. But if your blade is less than perfect, turn the countertop over and cut from the underside to avoid chipping the plastic laminate. In either case, cut the backsplash from behind.

Glue and tack a filler piece in place to fill out the countertop end to full thickness, flush with the edge. Then mount the end cap with contact cement. Trim the excess laminate from the end cap with a ﬁle, going carefully on the rounded portions so as not to mar the adjoining surfaces.
<h3>Other kinds of kitchen countertops</h3>
Plastic laminate, by far the most common countertop surfacing material, probably accounts for 75% of all kitchen work surfaces in America. It’s durable, colorful, readily available, and relatively inexpensive.

But there are alternatives to plastic laminate – in case you just happen to be sick and tired of it:
<h4>Corian and Avonite</h4>
These are marble-like, solid countertop materials that can be cut, shaped, and edged like a hardwood. The come in 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 in. thicknesses, and can be laminated to a substrate or installed as a self-supporting surface.

They are made in about a dozen colors, including veined, mottled, and textured patterns. Corian and Avonite are virtually indestructible; if surfaces eventually wear, they can simply be sanded smooth, since they are of the same material throughout.

Their cost is about 4 times as much as a plastic laminate countertop. Both are trademark names, sold mainly through kitchen design showrooms.
<h4>Butcher block</h4>
Butcher block sections are usually incorporated into a larger countertop area, or used to top an island or kitchen snack bar.

Butcher block shouldn’t be used near a sink; soap and water will cause deterioration. It is usually given a penetrating oil finish rather than a hard surface coating.

Sections 1-1/2 in. thick, and up to 8 ft. long and 25 in. wide are available at many home centers and lumber yards for about 2.5 times as much as plastic laminate.
<h4>Ceramic tile</h4>
It is a durable work surface for countertops: it’s colorful, holds up to hot pans and dishes and is easy to clean if the grout is treated with a sealer from time to time.

However, tiles can chip or crack if you drop heavy objects on them. Many tile manufacturers make special edging and corners for use on counters.

Tile requires a solid, flex-free substrate of plywood or cement board. Pricing is similar to plastic laminate.
<h4>Wood edging</h4>
It has lately become popular on all types of countertop surfaces because it gives a warmer look to these hard materials.

For maximum durability, use only hardwood, such as oak or birch, and finish the edge with polyurethane or other water-resistant varnish.

Edging is usually glued and tacked in place and finished after the surfacing material has been installed.
<h2>Planning a whole-room facelift for your kitchen</h2>
<h3>Painting cabinets</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>Painting cabinets with good results calls for through preparation. Remove doors; fill gouges and sand surfaces smooth; apply oil base primer.</li>
</ol>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kitchen-revival-whole-room-facelift-1-painting-cabinets-1.jpg" alt="" width="482" height="413" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1099" />

<ol start="2">
 	<li>Line up doors on a table, raised up on blocks of wood. Paint the edges first, then the backs, then the door faces. Use primer plus one or two topcoats.</li>

Shabby cabinets are the single biggest eyesore a kitchen can suffer, and painting them is the simplest and least expensive way to remedy the blight. But be advised that putting a first-rate paint job on cabinets is not quick. Here's the procedure:

If the interiors and shelves are in need of paint you’ll have to remove all the cabinet contents; it not, your groceries and dishes can stay in place. If you paint the interiors, first remove loose grime, stuck-on food and any sticky residue from shelf paper, then lightly sand all the surfaces, Paint with an oil-based paint.

To paint cabinet exteriors properly you should remove all doors, hinges, knobs or handles, Fill holes or gouges with wood filler and sand smooth Remove surface wax or grease using trisodium phosphate. Sand the surfaces lightly to remove any remaining film or residue, and to give the new paint additional bite.

Use an oil base primer, tinted to match the final color, and top with a highly washable oil base enamel — either one or two coats, as needed.

Paint the cabinet frame edges first, then the frame surfaces, then the exposed sides of the cabinets, working from top to bottom. Line up the doors lying flat on a large work surface, raised up on strips of scrap wood so you can paint around all the edges first. Then paint the door surfaces, back sides first. For raised panel doors, paint the center panels first. then the door edges, then the framing around the center panels. When the paint dries, turn the doors over and do the front sides.

Sand lightly between coats. Flow the final coat on carefully with long strokes, applying just enough paint so the brush marks level themselves out. Use a top-quality natural bristle brush.
<h3>Resurfacing cabinets</h3>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kitchen-revival-whole-room-facelift-2-resurface-cabinets.jpg" alt="" width="426" height="398" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1101" />

Resurface cabinets with new doors, new drawer fronts, and a self-adhesive veneer on the cabinet frames and sides; sand lightly and finish with stain and polyurethane.

If painted cabinets are not your cup of tea, you have two alternatives: You can strip and then refinish your cabinets with a natural stain and varnish— a procedure discussed brieﬂy below — or you can resurface your cabinet frames and outer sides with a new veneer, replace all the doors and drawer fronts, then stain and ﬁnish what is now an all-new wood exterior.

The photo that follows shows a sampling of the components required to do this job. Replacement drawer fronts and doors — most frequently raised panel, in solid oak — are available in a variety of sizes and styles to accommodate your existing cabinet openings. Self-adhesive peel-and-stick oak veneer sheets are applied to cabinet sides, and cut into strips for the frames. You may also need to purchase new moldings to install along the tops of the wall cabinets. The new surfaces require only modest sanding before applying the stain and varnish ﬁnish.

The major suppliers of these resurfacing materials have products sold through home centers and lumber yards. The manufacturers provide detailed brochures describing purchasing and installation procedures.
<h4>Refinishing cabinets</h4>

Although stripping and reﬁnishing is less expensive than giving cabinets a new exterior, doing the job is no picnic. Stripping is messy and smelly, and you can’t really predict the outcome.

A few hints: Don’t try going from a dark to a light stain color unless you like blotches. Don’t attempt a stain and varnish finish on cabinets that have been painted; the wood is probably unattractive. Take one of your cabinet doors to a full-service paint store and get expert advice on the best stripper, stain and finish to use.
<h3>Replacing kitchen cabinet hardware</h3>

Replace cabinet hardware with new knobs or pulls that are compatible with existing holes. Drawer slides need 1/2-in. side clearance.

New handles or knobs can give your cabinets new appeal, especially if you choose from among some of the colorful plastic varieties available. When replacing handles that are held in place with two screws, be sure to buy your new handles with screws the same distance apart. If you now have single-screw knobs on your doors, you can probably replace them with two-screw handles by drilling another hole, providing the handle location looks alright.

Replace worn hinges with new ones of the same general size, type and conﬁguration. Make sure screw holes match, so you won’t have to fill old holes and drill new ones in doors or frames. Worn metal drawer slides are easy to replace with new slides of the same type. If you don't now have slides you can add them as long as you have 1/2 in. clearance on both sides of the drawer.
<h3>New kitchen flooring</h3>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kitchen-revival-whole-room-facelift-4-new-flooring.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="547" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1103" />

Put down wood flooring with adhesive. Hardwood strips are pre-finished, but for kitchen should have additional high-wear topcoating.

Floors in the kitchen lead a hard life, and will probably be ready for renewal or replacement about the same time as your counter and sink.

One-piece vinyl is still the favored, and most practical kitchen floor covering, but hardwood is rapidly gaining in popularity. Two reasons for this:
<ul>
 	<li>Now widely available in 3/8-in. thickness, and put down with adhesive rather than nails, a new hardwood ﬂoor is a very do-it-yourselfable project.</li>
 	<li>Second, there are many new wood floor finishes that are tough, highly water-resistant, and durable enough for the kitchen.</li>
</ul>
However, most of the preﬁnished wood flooring that's available does not have this really tough kitchen-grade finish, so plan on adding a ﬁnal coat of finish yourself after installation. Check with a knowledgeable paint store sales-person for a finish that’s compatible with the prefinish on the flooring, and offers good wear and water resistance.
<h3>Kitchen Lighting</h3>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kitchen-revival-whole-room-facelift-5-lighting.jpg" alt="" width="380" height="350" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1104" />

Undercabinet lighting provides shadow-free illumination on work surfaces. Fixtures approximately 1 in. thick hide behind cabinet frame.

The kitchen is a tough room to light adequately, since it's a room of such varied uses. Even tougher is to make this adequate lighting enhance the overall look and feel of the room — without harsh glare, hot spots, unsightly ﬁxtures or areas of over- or under-illumination.

Task lighting mounted on the underside of wall cabinets, as shown here, is an effective way to get good light on countertop work surfaces without over-illuminating the whole room. It also keeps you from working in your own shadow.

Units are available in several lengths, so make sure to choose the thinner units, so they can tuck out of sight behind the cabinet frames. Use a “warm white” or “soft white" light temperature to eliminate harsh glares. Hook the fixture to a wall switch so you won’t have to grope to turn it on and off.

For overall room lighting in the kitchen, you may want to replace an old incandescent ceiling fixture with a new LED model, again using "warm" or “soft” temperatures. Newer fixtures are often enclosed in attractive wood cases that can be matched to your cabinetry.

For an eat-in kitchen, consider a hanging fixture over the table. It should project light both upward and downward, and contribute to the room's overall lighting as well as just the immediate table area.
<h3>Replacing a window</h3>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kitchen-revival-whole-room-facelift-6-new-window.jpg" alt="" width="354" height="298" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1105" />

Install a new window behind the sink to give more light, expand the room’s appearance, and provide better ventilation.

Does your kitchen feel cramped — smaller than it really is? Installing a new window behind the sink can make a radical change in the way your kitchen feels for a relatively modest investment in time and money.

The new garden window, shown here, installed along with the new countertop adds nothing to the room's floor area. But as a replacement for a small, older double-hung window, it transforms the room by projecting it outward, and makes the room feel much larger than it really is. It also admits far more light, and the crank-out units are much easier to operate.

A conventional bay window will give you the same room—expanding effect, and even a flat, crank-out double casement window, with its greater glass surface, will produce a more airy, opened-up feeling.

In most cases you can replace a window without major structural changes. However, you’ll probably want to widen the overall window opening and this requires rearrangement of some wall studs and installing a new header — the supporting beam above the window.

You‘ll also have to do some reﬁnishing of the walls around the window, both inside and outside. And you should check for any plumbing vent line or heating duct in the wall near the window that may need to be moved. In general, installing a new window is within the ability of most ambitious do-it-yourselfers, although you will need help lifting the new unit into place.

Casement windows, bays and garden windows come as ready-made units, completely prefabricated, often prefinished, and in a variety of sizes. They are available in wood, metal and plastic cladding. You can spend anywhere from $200 for a low-end double casement window to as much as $1,200 for a 4-ft.-wide top quality, double-insulated garden window.
<h3>Papering and painting</h3>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kitchen-revival-whole-room-facelift-7-papering-and-painting.jpg" alt="" width="354" height="299" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1106" />

Paint or wallpaper walls and trim with highly washable materials; use oil base paint and cloth backed vinyl wallcovering.

Dealing with the kitchen’s walls and trim is the final touch. Although these may seem like simple work, the care and neatness you exercise here can make all the difference in the world in your project‘s overall appearance.

Use masking tape and drop cloths to keep paint off surfaces you don’t want painted: prepare walls and woodwork carefully before painting or papering.

Kitchen surfaces must be washable, so use only good quality, scrubbable latex or oil base paint and durable cloth backed vinyl wallcovering.
<h2>Kitchen cabinet storage that creates space and convenience</h2>
In the perfect kitchen every item is neatly stored away, yet stays right at your fingertips. Impossible, you say?

You can get help with the space-making cabinet accessories shown here. They put every inch of your cabinets to work. Most of them can be installed in a few minutes. Keep in mind that for peak efficiency, the accessory should fill the width of the cabinet opening, if possible.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Do you sometimes think you're outgrowing your home? Did the rooms seem much bigger when you moved in? Whatever happened to all that space?

No. your home isn't shrinking before your eyes. It just feels that way. If the cramped rooms in your house or apartment are reminding you all too often of the dimensions of your decorating budget, we have some ideas for you to change all that — without moving a wall or raising the roof. You can create the illusion of more space, and save the expense of that pricey addition.

I rounded up four of the easiest, most ingenious, and least expensive solutions we've ever found to the space-crunch problem.

One of these sleight of hand solutions may well be the answer to your space crunch. Or, if you’re really clever, you may put all four to work in your home.
<h2>Color</h2>
<strong>Focus attention on decorative elements (bright white woodwork, shutters, wicker furniture, pictures, etc.) by painting the walls a deep navy blue to make them visually recede. This creates an illusion of greater depth and the room feels bigger because the walls have, in effect, disappeared.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1124" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/make-small-room-seem-larger-01.jpg" alt="" width="808" height="885" />

<strong>White walls can enlarge a room as well, but for different reasons. In this room a monochromatic color scheme of creamy off-white walls and furniture offers a sense of spaciousness through a minimum of clutter.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1125" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/make-small-room-seem-larger-02.jpg" alt="" width="652" height="522" />

The most common technique for changing the apparent shape and size of a room is changing its color. Two gallons of paint, a few hours work, and presto! — you have a whole new look.

The lighter the color, the bigger the feel of the room, right? Well, not exactly. There‘s more to color than meets the eye.

For the last twenty years, the typical remedy for a room diagnosed as too small has been to paint everything (walls, ceilings, moldings) a dazzling white. But ﬂat-out, pure white isn’t exactly a warm color, is it? Besides, it gets boring. Here are some alternatives.
<h3>Two alternatives to white</h3>
You want a bigger-looking room, but do you also want the color to lend warmth and visual interest? To set a mood? To complement your furnishings?

To begin with, keep in mind that if your rooms are making you feel claustrophobic, chances are it’s more than merely their size that's bothering you. You may be reacting to a displeasing color scheme. That’s a snap to change.

Decorated tastefully and with an eye to maximizing the look of its space, you’ll feel more at ease, more likely to sit down in the room and enjoy yourself, stretch out and relax.

A very light color can be just as effective as white when it comes to your ﬁrst requirement: creating the illusion of space. For a warmer, more intimate atmosphere, choose an off-white, a cream or ivory.

Remember the rule about clutter: it makes a room feel smaller. The same applies here. Don’t clutter your color scheme either. Paint everything — wall, ceilings, and woodwork — the same color. This approach works best if your carpet and furnishings are very light, too.

If you wish the color to assert itself a bit more — perhaps to harmonize with furnishings or to offer a muted back- ground for a particular accent color in the room, you can add a very pale tint and still preserve the illusion of more space. It's the uniform lightness of the color scheme that lends the feeling of spaciousness.

But remember that the tint should be so light as to be almost imperceptible. Say, for instance, you add a hint of pink to the paint. You will sense its presence in the room — pink even in minute doses ﬂatters skin tones and softens a room — but you wouldn't call it a pink, or even a pinkish room. You would call it
white.

My second suggestion may surprise you. Dark colors can open up a small room by making the walls appear to recede from your eye.

<strong>Caution</strong>: This technique takes conﬁdence and a sure touch. It works only in rooms with lots of windows and light, and the higher the ceiling the better. Plus, the room should be able to accommodate a few fairly large pieces of furniture and artwork.

OK, the principle at work here is the same one you apply when buying clothes: Very dark colors tend to make you look thinner; bright colors have the opposite effect, drawing the eye immediately to them and to your body!

Paint the walls and ceiling a dark color, and watch them seem to recede behind those bold objects in the room. When this works, it works very dramatically. The walls and ceiling become backdrops to the objects in the room, rather than backstops for the eye, and you notice the objects rather than the walls.

Cool colors such as dark blue and dark green are particularly effective, especially if used on one wall only. Very deep reds and corals will accomplish the same thing as the cooler blues and greens, but red tones can have the reverse effect if you’re not careful to choose very dark shades. A bright red room or a bright blue room will both seem smaller than a dark red or dark blue room.

Deep-tone colors are more 60-70% expensive, compared to ﬂat white latex. But when you compare these prices to the cost of that new addition…

<h2>Moldings</h2>
<strong>Furniture that seemed too big for this room when the walls were white, fell right when "anchored" to deep green wallpaper bordered by moldings, and white paint. This scheme lends interest and organization to the room by giving the eye directions for where to go next.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1126" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/make-small-room-seem-larger-03-1024x490.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="267" />

<strong>Transform a claustrophobic hallway with moldings. Note the placement of moldings just below the eye level, and the use of twin strips of wood separated by white space.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1127" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/make-small-room-seem-larger-04.jpg" alt="" width="655" height="643" />

No room should be without moldings.

Wait a minute! Won't they just add to the clutter? Won’t they make an already small living room seem even tinier?

I’m not contradicting myself. Moldings have just the opposite effect. They accent and enhance a room‘s natural gifts, its scale and proportion, its immaculate lines and no-nonsense right angles.

Trace the lines where walls meet ceiling or floor with a simple wood molding, and you will not only add character and distinction to the room — you will also have tricked the eye into believing the room is bigger.

Really!

What‘s more, moldings are inexpensive – be it a plain picture molding or a fancier crown molding. And you don't need a master carpenter to install them. You can do it yourself. Check out my article about installing finish trim.
<h3>Where to install a chair rail</h3>
The most dramatic room-enlarging effect is created by a simple molding called a chair rail. The name comes from its original purpose, to protect walls, especially in dining rooms, from scrapes caused by chairs backed into them.

Any room in the house may be beautiﬁed by a chair rail, which is simply a strip of wood that horizontally bisects a room. The uninterrupted horizontal line entices the eye and thus seems to elongate the room. Very clever — and very easy to accomplish.

Your chair rail should be located just above or below major pieces of furniture (so they don’t hide it or interrupt the line). Pick a spot one third of the distance from the ﬂoor to the ceiling and you’re in the right neighborhood. Trace the line with masking tape and stand back far enough to measure the visual impact. Adjust the tape (take care to apply it gently) until you're satisﬁed. Now you‘re ready to install the chair rail.
<h3>Stain or paint?</h3>
A natural ﬁnish on molding is attractive, but a painted ﬁnish will work harder to create the illusion of space in a small room. The point is not to focus attention on your space-stretching technique — in this case, wood moldings — but to create an overall effect of spaciousness.

Paint the trim—all the trim—in a satin or semi-gloss enamel. Off-white trim matching your off-white walls will do wonders for a small room, adding a touch of elegance that small spaces so often lack.
<h2>Storage</h2>
<strong>Giant-sized performance from a tiny laundry room, thanks to stacked wire baskets and combination rod and storage shelf placed above the washer/dryer.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1128" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/make-small-room-seem-larger-05.jpg" alt="" width="346" height="384" />

<strong>(left)Space in closets is maximized with wood and wire components. But use the space well: use a double row of hangers; put little-used items in remote areas of the closet.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1129" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/make-small-room-seem-larger-06-1024x438.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="238" />

<strong>Cabinets aren't only for kitchens. Installed in a busy workshop, a wall of drawers and cabinets is a stream-lined space-saver.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1130" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/make-small-room-seem-larger-07.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="407" />

I know what you’re thinking.

“These suggestions all sound wonderful, but how can I reduce the clutter in my home? That’s what makes it feel claustrophobic. I’m not about to just pitch Aunt Bessy's needlepoint cushions just because I can’t use them just now. I need storage space!”

I’m not suggesting a garage sale. Not yet.

First, peek inside those crowded closets, the ones that are so packed you’re afraid to open the door.

Pretty chaotic, eh?

Now you’re getting it. What you need is to <strong>get organized</strong>. And by that I don’t mean tidy up. We’re talking about a major restructuring of your storage space, so that every square inch gets used.

Look once more inside the closet. See how everything is stored in the middle? That’s because the middle is where the shelves are. You can change that. Add a shelf or two at the top and put the things you don‘t often use up there — out of sight, out of mind! Goodbye to Aunt Bessy’ s needlepoint cushions — until further notice.

Now look at the ﬂoor. You could use a shelf or two down there, too.

Shelves, baskets, hooks, hanger rods — all of these storage devices, installed in just the right places, may effectively triple the storage space in a single, hopelessly overcrowded closet.
<h3>The secret of storage</h3>
With more and more of us complaining about feeling not only overcrowded but overextended — in other words, disorganized — more and more manufacturers are coming to the rescue with ingenious new products. Ingenious and attractive solutions exist in a range of shapes. sizes, styles, and materials from melamine to metal.

If you’re basically organized you can apply some common sense and restructure your closets yourself. But if you‘re one of those people for whom lost car keys are a routine nuisance, you may need professional help. Storage is fast becoming a science, and salespeople at stores selling storage products can steer you to invaluable shortcuts.

Generally there‘s no extra charge for a simple closet design. As for the products themselves, they vary depending on the materials. The average six-foot closet costs around $200 to ﬁll with a state-of-the-art wire storage system. Keep in mind though, that wire systems are about half the cost of wood systems.
<h2>Mirrors</h2>
<strong>Double the apparent size of a room by using two pairs of mirrored doors. In this case, they also eliminate the eyesore pair of metal bifolds. Great for bedroom, mirrored closet doors (bifold and sliding) are available at most home centers.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1131" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/make-small-room-seem-larger-08.jpg" alt="" width="721" height="461" />

“Mirror, mirror, on the wall, can you make this room seem… not so small?”

The ﬁrst step is to open your mind to the space-stretching potential of a simple sheet of reﬂective glass. Yes, the same material that graces the top of your medicine cabinet, the one that greets you each morning with your own rumpled image, splattered in toothpaste.

In the beginning. mirrors were made for small spaces, not medicine chests. Mirrors are illusionary gifts to small rooms, making them seem twice as big, twice as interesting, at a tiny fraction of the cost of actually pushing out those walls and ﬁlling up the new space with furniture.

A do-it-yourselfer can install closet doors that come complete with full-length mirrors attached. A couple of these will transform your utilitarian bedroom into an elegant boudoir.

Expect to pay around $200 for a four-foot, standard height mirrored sliding door. And then, be prepared to want a mirror in every room in the house.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Can I use latex paint to paint stucco?</h2>
If you own a stucco house and you thought about painting it, you may or may not be aware that latex paint isn't recommended for stucco because it prevents the house from breathing.

<strong>Latex paint actually seals the stucco, causing it to get harder with age. Stucco needs to be able to breathe, or you could be in for trouble. It might take 5 years or 20, but either way, the painted stucco will likely start to crumble and fall away. Then you’ll be faced with sandblasting or having all new stucco applied.</strong>
<h2>And how can you paint stucco?</h2>
<strong>A 50/50 mixture of Portland cement and an aggregate (usually silica sand) can be applied, but this mixture is only recommended for stucco with a heavy texture.</strong>

And, it's very tricky to work with, even for professionals. If you’ve never attempted this, you’ll probably want to hire a stucco contractor.

Due to climatic conditions, stucco homes in different areas of the country can have different problems and solutions. It’s best to contact a stucco specialist in your area if you’re experiencing trouble.

		<title>Personal Protection Equipment (PPE): Choosing the right Respirators</title>
		<link>http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/respirators/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ll make selecting the right respirator as easy as possible—so you’ll buy one and use it for your own good!

How often have you round yourself eyeball deep in clouds of dust, paint vapors or other airborne pollutants, while hard at work and home improvement project? Frequently, I'll bet.

Fortunately, few home improvement materials release dangerous substances in high enough concentrations to become life-threatening. <strong>Lead dust from old paint and asbestos are two exceptions— call on trained experts to handle these.</strong>

Still, we can inhale enough bad stuff to cause throat irritations, headaches, coughing and other temporary discomforts.

A <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/small-woodshop-dust-collection/">workspace with good dust collection</a> and good ventilation is the best defense against these airborne pollutants. But you often need a good second defense too—a respirator.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ppe-respirator.jpg" alt="" width="594" height="601" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1137" />

In this article I will tell you what pollutants to watch out for and how to choose a respirator to protect yourself from them. Indeed, I make no bones about it. I think every homeowner should own and regularly use at least one, and perhaps several, of these respirators

<h2>How to choose a respirator</h2>

Manufacturers make a variety of specialized masks that balance comfort, weight and cost with effective protection from specific pollutants So to choose the best breathing protection, you have to know what substance you're trying to stop.

Fortunately, most common pollutants fall into one of two easily recognized groups:

<ol><li>Dusts and mists</strong>, and
<li>vapors and gases.</li></ol>

<h3>Dusts and mists</h3>

They are small, solid or liquid particles that ﬂoat in the air yet can be easily trapped by a mesh filter. They include sawdust, drywall dust and dusts from various types of insulation. They can penetrate deeply into your lungs.

A rising dust or mist cloud is a good signal to put on a filtration device, But you often can't see smaller dust particles like insulation fibers and metal dusts. You simply have to anticipate them and wear your dust mask for protection.

The picture shows three styles: two disposable types and a more expensive silicone mask with a replaceable filter. <strong>All work well if they fit well. </strong> For a mask to work, it must seal tightly to your face so pollutants can‘t leak in around the edges. Notice that all three masks have two straps to ensure a better seal. Masks with one strap, while better than nothing, can‘t make a good seal.

A dust mask's ﬁltration actually tends to improve as particles load up on the ﬁlter, but when breathing becomes more difﬁcult, change the ﬁlter or discard the mask.

<h3Vapors and gases</h3>

This second category of pollutants, vapors and gases, is made up of particles that are too small to be trapped in a mesh. Special charcoal ﬁlters (called “organic vapor" ﬁlters) chemically absorb these substances.

Most harmful vapors and gases around the home come from solvents that evaporate from paints and strong cleaning agents like paint thinner and paint stripper.

While you can't see them, you can almost always smell them, which is your signal to check the container to determine if the vapors are hazardous. On most solvent containers you'll ﬁnd the word “DANGER” or some other warning followed by proper handling instructions.

You don't want to breathe the vapors of any of these substances, so wear a special “organic vapor" respirator and maintain good ventilation in your work area.

The respirators in the picture have replaceable cartridges and adjustable straps so you can get a seal that's tight to your face. If you begin to smell a solvent through your mask, the cartridge is worn out and should be changed.

Incidentally, methylene chloride, the traditional active ingredient in fast-acting paint strippers, is the most dangerous vapor you're likely to encounter in home-use products So always ventilate well when using it and wear your organic vapor breathing device.

<h3>Paint spray and other pollutants</h3>

Whether they're sprayed from a can or from a power sprayer, paint sprays create a ﬁne mist in addition to paint vapors.

So the proper respirator combines the ﬁltration of the two previous types of masks—a mist ﬁlter and an organic vapor ﬁlter (see pictures).

Neither one by itself will do the job. Smoke from burning wood, leaves, paper or tobacco contains both particles and vapors, so you'll need a combination mask if you have to work in smoky areas.

But <strong>no filter or cartridge will stop smoke's most dangerous component, carbon monoxide. So avoid smoke whenever possible</strong>.

Finally, some pollutants require special ﬁltration. The most common and potentially dangerous of these are pesticides, substances that are extremely toxic. Don't inhale any of this stuff, whether in dust form or in mists. <strong>Use a silicone or rubber mask and ﬁlters speciﬁcally rated for pesticide use</strong>.

You'll also need special protection when you weld. In welding, some extremely toxic metals can vaporize and become suspended in the air as fumes. So wear a respirator that‘s specially rated for fumes.

<h2>Rating respirators</h2>

How do you know if a mask actually works? The best way is to buy only those masks carrying the ofﬁcial test mark “NIOSH Approved” (including a test number beginning with the letters TC). NIOSH stands for the <a href= "https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/index.htm">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health</a>.

The mask and ﬁltration device will list the categories of pollutants for which it's approved: dusts, mists, vapors, fumes, gases, pesticides, paint mists, and/or others. This assures you that the mask or cartridge has been tested for these types of pollutants and meets ofﬁcial standards.

<h2>Finding a good respirator</h2>

You can usually find a variety of NIOSH-approved masks and respirators at home centers and full-service hardware stores. Often you'll see the familiar single-strap fabric dust mask too. These are not approved and do not ﬁlter nearly as well as the two-strap styles.

But no matter how well the ﬁlter works, a respirator can do a good job only if it doesn't leak. Each time you put your mask on, make sure it seals tightly to your face so air can't leak in around the edges.

In general, the silicone or rubber masks that we show seal better than the fabric disposables. However, every face is unique. So you might have to try on several sizes or brands of silicone masks before you ﬁnd one that seals well.

Unfortunately, many home centers and hardware stores carry only one size and brand, If you can’t get a good fit, go to a store that specializes in safety equipment to find a wider selection.

Incidentally. men with beards will probably not be able to get a good seal on any mask, no matter what they do.

If you buy a silicone or rubber mask, be sure to wipe it clean periodically and store it in a plastic bag.

<h2>My recommendation</h2>

I recommend that every DIYer buy a good-fitting silicone or rubber mask with two filtration attachments, one for dusts and mists and one for vapors and gases. You can combine them when you spray paint. That way you‘ll be sure to always have adequate protection.

But we also recommend that you keep some two-strap disposable dust masks handy too. These masks don't cost much, and are ideal for a second person who's watching or helping you work in a dusty room. In fact, you'll also like them when you don't feel like putting on that heavier, hotter silicone mask.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>10 Tips for using the Reciprocating Saw like a PRO</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The reciprocating saw isn't a tool for every do-it-yourselfer on the block. But it you're looking forward to any serious renovation work — sawing through walls, sheathing, and subflooring, it may just be the tool you fall in love with for life. To cut a new doorway or make an opening in the roof for a skylight, the reciprocating saw is unexcelled.

The reciprocating saw used to be a tool for the professional only — plumbers, electricians, and contractors — mainly because they were expensive. They're still not cheap, but now half a dozen tool manufacturers make good quality models for the general consumer market with low prices.

<h2>Tips For Better Use</h2>

Determine the amount at cutting pressure to apply by trial and error. With a little practice it's easy in get the feel of it. Too little pressure will cause vibration and broken blades. Too much pressure will give you a rough, inaccurate cut. Rocking the saw gently up and down as you cut will often speed the cutting.

Form precise, straight-line cuts - for example, if you need to saw horizontally through a row of several studs - by starting each cut with a circular saw, as deep as it will go, then finishing the cuts with the reciprocating saw.

Start cutting a hole with a plunge saw to save time, as shown in the picture. You don't need to drill a starter hole. Hold the front of the saw firmly down on the bottom of its shoe, as shown, then rotate the tip of the blade down into the wood by slowly pulling up on the handle. Of course, in some situations you may need to drill a starter hole and then insert the blade and cut as you would with a jigsaw.

Cut thick material such as layers of roofing or sheathing, or the full thickness of a wall, using  a long, wood-cutting blade. Keep the glide firmly against the surface of the material as you cut, as per the picture.

<h2>10 Tips For getting the best out of the Reciprocating Saw</h2>

<ol>
<li>Drill a starter hole to start the blade on hard or irregular surfaces. This saw is ideal for rough cutting in thick and uneven material.</li>
</ol>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/reciprocating-saw-1.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="571" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1146" />

<ol start="2">
<li>A bimetal blade cuts both wood and metal in hard-to-get-at locations. For faster cutting, rock the saw gently in a vertical motion.</li>
</ol>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/reciprocating-saw-2.jpg" alt="" width="437" height="320" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1147" />

<ol start="3">
<li>Start a plunge cut by resting the shoe and the tip of the blade on the surface. Hold the nose down while pulling up on the handle.</li>
</ol>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/reciprocating-saw-3.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="359" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1148" />

<ol start="4">
<li>Pry siding or trim loose, then cut nails behind to remove the wood without damage. The blade can be reversed for a tighter cut.</li>
</ol>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/reciprocating-saw-4.jpg" alt="" width="377" height="307" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1149" />

<ol start="5">
<li>A long blade, combined with a short stroke (usually 1-1/4 in.), allows a single cut through a wall. Keep the shoe against the surface wherever possible.</li>
</ol>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/reciprocating-saw-5.jpg" alt="" width="402" height="347" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1150" />

<ol start="6">
<li>The reciprocating saw is a bulky tool. And since you're than using it overhead or in confined spots, always hold it securely with both hands. Most saws have a rubber boot calming their front end to give you a good, sure grip, and to minimize the danger of electrical shock.</li>
<li>Before cutting into walls, always check for electrical and water lines. If you're not sure what's back there, cut a small hole first and probe with a wire coat hanger.</li>
<li>If the blade binds or bends when cutting, don't grab the blade to straighten it. It's likely to be sizzling hot and will give you a nasty burn.</li>
<li>As with all power curlers, wear safety goggles.</li>
<li>Blade changing requires a hex key on most reciprocating saws - a two-handed operation. Always pull the plug first.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Fast, Maneuverable Cutter</h2>

The biggest virtue of the reciprocating saw is it maneuverability. I use it time and again to get into those corners and tight spots that my circular saw can't reach.

It can cut deeper, faster, and more solely through thicker materials than the heaviest-duty model of any other type of power saw.

Here's what makes the reciprocating saw so much more versatile: circular saws and jigsaws have blade guards and shoes around their blades that limit their maneuverability and depth of cut.

But with its unrestricted blade, the reciprocating saw doesn't have these limits. You can poke the blade into almost my place you want to cut. Yet, even with its open blade, it's not an unduly danger ous tool, thanks to the relatively short stroke (the "reciprocating" back-and-forth action) of the blade. Sure, you can still use it dangerously, but you have to work at it.

The reciprocating saw isn't tor fine carpentry. It's at its best on fairly rough construction, such as cutting away studs and slicing through plaster and lathe for openings. It can cut through exterior walls and interior studs in one pass, and with just a little practice you'll be able to saw accurately enough to install door jambs or window frames directly into those openings without further trimming.

And because the blades are relatively cheap, you don't need to worry much about hitting an occasional nail.

In fact, cutting through hard-to-get-at nails, screws, bolts or metal pipe is another of the tool's strengths. With the right blade, it's a quick and easy job to slice through the nails securing trim, or to cut out window or door frames without destroying the wood, as in the photo.

<h2>The Cutting Edge</h2>

The reciprocating saw is a workhorse tool, but only if you use the right blade. The type of material you're cutting, its thickness, and the shape of the cut - that is, straight or curved — all influence your blade selection. For example, for a curved cut is in the image, you'll want a somewhat narrower blade than for straight cuts.

Lots of different blades are available for wood and metal: Wood-cutting blades come in various widths, and up to 12 in. long, with teeth ranging from medium size to coarse. Metal-cutting blades are usually shorter and have finer teeth. You can also buy tungsten carbide blades that will hack through any nail in your way, or bimetal blades, which work equally well on wood or metal. These last two types cost a bit more, but they last much longer. Bimetal blades are less likely to break when bent, and you can usually straighten them for reuse.

And you on count on bending or breaking a blade now and then, because of the way the saw operates. It usually happens when the tip at the blade comes out of the cut and bangs against the surface of the material you're cutting.

I find I can usually avoid this by using a long enough blade so that it cuts through the material with at least an inch to spare in its least extended position.

		<title>How to replace broken glass by yourself (with pictures)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[How To Replace Broken Glass

Fragile, thin, nearly invisible — glass is the weakest link in our solid homes of concrete, brick and wood. And sooner or later one of those weak links is going to break.

Fortunately, replacing a pane of glass is a task most homeowners can do. It involves few tools, little time and not much expense.

It's quickest to repair windows in place (though you may elect to first remove, then repair simple storm windows).

Wear gloves and eye protection when removing the broken glass. A pliers will give you even more distance from razor-sharp, jagged edges.

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
<li>Soften the old putty with a heat gun or heat lamp. Remove the old putty, glass, and glazing points. Gloves and a pliers will help you safely remove the old glass.</li>
</ol>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/how-to-replace-broken-glass-1.jpg" alt="" width="493" height="403" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1153" />

<ol start="2">
<li>Lay a small bead of compound (about 1/4 in. in diameter) in the rabbet. Prime and paint the rabbet beforehand to help protect the window from moisture damage.</li>
</ol>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/how-to-replace-broken-glass-2.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="292" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1154" />

<ol start="3">
<li>Press the new pane of glass firmly in place. The glass should be cut about 1/8 in. smaller than the opening in both directions.</li>
</ol>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/how-to-replace-broken-glass-3.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="296" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1155" />

<ol start="4">
<li>Push the glazing points in place, snugging them firmly against the glass every 4 in. along the perimeter. The small “ears” on these glazing points make it easy to press them into the wood frame with a stiff putty knife.</li>
</ol>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/how-to-replace-broken-glass-4.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="299" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1156" />

<ol start="5">
<li>Apply and smooth the compound on the exterior of the window. After the compound cures (in about a week of moderate weather), paint it to protect it.</li>
</ol>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/how-to-replace-broken-glass-5.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="234" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1157" />

<h2>Final Tips and Reminders</h2>

A heat lamp or heat gun will help soften old putty. To make sure your new window pane seals tightly, thoroughly scrape and remove all the old putty and paint.

Repaint the opening before installing the new glass to prevent future moisture damage.

Have your hardware store cut your new pane of glass 1/8 in. smaller in both height and width than the actual opening. If you have a lot of windows all the same size, have an extra pane cut as a spare.

Run a 1/4-in. dia. bead of caulk or glazing compound along the rabbet of the opening, then press the new pane in place.

Install the glazing points and compound as shown.

Wait about a week for the compound to cure, then paint the surrounding frame and compound, lapping the paint onto the glass about 1/16 in. to seal and protect the edge of the compound.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Your home may be filled with fire hazards that aren’t obvious. Here’s where to look, and what you should own to make your home safer.

Does your family know what to do if a fire breaks out in your home? Have you ever checked your home for potential fire hazards? If you answer “no” to either question, your family could be in danger.

You’ll see fire hazards in your home you might not be aware of and how to reduce these risks, products to help protect your home and, most importantly, what to do if there is a fire.

<h2>A hazard can hide</h2>

Some fire hazards are fairly obvious, like storing gasoline near your furnace, or smoking in bed. People should know better than to make either of these mistakes

But, some fire hazards aren’t so obvious. They can be found in almost every room of the house. Have you checked your house for the hidden hazards?

<h2>Fire facts</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://apps.usfa.fema.gov/civilian-fatalities/incident/reportMap">1339 civilian home fire deaths</a> between January 1st, 2018 and June 16, 2018, according to FEMA.</li>
<li>Matches and lighters are involved in 94.4% of fires set by children.</li>
<li>Most home fires start at night, during sleeping hours.</li>
<li>Most fatal home fires occur in homes without smoke detectors.</li>
<li>Children under the age of 10 are twice as likely to die in fire than a person between ages 10-64.</li>
<li>Persons aged 65 and older are three times more likely to die in a fire than a person between ages 10-64.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hazards and cures</h2>

Use this section to inspect your home. You might prevent a fire.

<h3>Hazard: matches and lighters</h3>

<strong>Cure</strong>: Keep them away from children. Out of reach and out of sight. They should be used only by adults.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/fire-hazard-matches.jpg" alt="" width="658" height="635" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1165" />

<h3>Hazard: improper use of space heaters</h3>
<strong>Cure</strong>: Use only laboratory/UL approved heaters. Keep space heaters at least 3 feet from furniture, drapes or other flammable materials. Keep children away, too. Turn heaters off before leaving home or going to bed.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/fire-hazard-space-heaters.jpg" alt="" width="495" height="406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1169" />

<h3>Hazard: careless cooking</h3>
<strong>Cure</strong>: Pay attention when cooking at the stove. Keep sleeves buttoned or tightly rolled, or wear short sleeves. Keep pot handles turned in, so pots can't be tipped accidently. Never climb on or reach over a stove.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/fire-hazard-stove.jpg" alt="" width="339" height="283" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1170" />

<h3>Hazard: overloaded outlets</h3>
<strong>Cure</strong>: Prevent outlet overloading and having octopus outlets by using a laboratory/UL approved strip outlet. Make sure it has a built-in circuit breaker.

Also, repair or replace any defective cords or plugs, Never run extension cords under furniture or rugs.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/fire-hazard-outlets.jpg" alt="" width="508" height="395" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1166" />

<h3>Hazard: dirty or damaged fireplace or chimney</h3>
<strong>Cure</strong>: Have the chimney and fireplace inspected annually. Check for cracks, crumbling bricks, obstructions and creosote build-up. A professional chimney sweep can perform both cleaning and inspection. Stop flying sparks with a fireplace screen or approved fireplace doors.

If you use your fireplace regularly, keep a chimney fire extinguisher nearby. When used correctly, it slows the spread of a chimney fire and can provide the extra minutes of fire control needed before the fire department arrives.

<h3>Hazard: dirty workshop</h3>
<strong>Cure</strong>: <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/small-woodshop-dust-collection/">Clean up shavings, sawdust and debris</a>, on and around the work area, immediately after work is finished. A single spark from an electric motor can ignite sawdust.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/fire-hazard-workshop.jpg" alt="" width="551" height="530" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1171" />

<h3>Hazard: paint/shop rags</h3>
<strong>Cure</strong>: Clean up old paint or shop rags and throw them away. Or, if you want to use them again, store in an airtight, metal container. These rags are extremely flammable.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/fire-hazard-shop-rags.jpg" alt="" width="491" height="609" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1168" />

<h3>Hazard: faulty electrical system</h3>
<strong>Cure</strong>: Have your local electrical inspector inspect and certify your electrical system, especially if it’s been added to, or altered. Follow all electrical codes, both national and local.

Have additional outlets installed, instead of relying on extension cords. Make sure special appliances, such as air conditioners or large space heaters, have their own correct size circuit.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/fire-hazard-electrical-system.jpg" alt="" width="328" height="236" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1162" />

<h3>Hazard: flammable liquids</h3>
<strong>Cure</strong>: Store all flammable liquids in their original containers with lids tightly closed and away from heat. Keep out of reach of children. Never smoke when working with or near any flammable liquid.

Use the appropriate container for fuel storage (gasoline can for gasoline, kerosene can for kerosene). Store all fuels in a garage (wall farthest from living area) or shed, never in the house.

<h2>What to do if there’s a fire</h2>

<ul>
<li>Stay calm. Carry out your escape plan in an orderly fashion. Panic can spell disaster.</li>
<li>Alert everyone. Make sure all occupants know there’s a fire. Shout out a clear warning: “FIRE! EVERYONE GET OUTSIDE!”</li>
<li>Escape. Get out of the house immediately. Don’t waste precious time getting dressed, or gathering valuables.</li>
<li>Feel a door before opening it. If the door’s hot, or there’s smoke coming in underneath it, don’t open it. Use your secondary room exit.</li>
<li>If there’s smoke crawl. Get on your hands and knees. The safestair is between 12 and 36 inches off the floor.</li>
<li>If your clothes catch on fire: Stop, Drop, and Roll. Cover your face with your hands. Never run, because running gives the fire more oxygen.</li>
<li>Meet. Go to designated meeting spot. Count heads to see that everyone’s accounted for. But, DON’T GO BACK IN THE HOUSE. Leave the rescuing to the fire department.</li>
<li>Call. USE YOUR CELL PHONE. If there’s a fire alarm box, use it. Or go to a neighbor’s house to call the fire department. Don’t attempt to use your landline; it’s too dangerous.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Plan your escape</h2>

Smoke detectors can alert you to a fire, but without an escape plan. you‘re still in danger. Every family member must know how to react and where to go, in case of a fire.

The <a href="https://www.nfpa.org/">NFPA</a> has developed EDITH (Exit Drills In The Home). With EDITH’s help, you can formulate your family's escape plan.

<ul>
<li>Make a list of all possible exits from your home.</li>
<li>Locate two exits from each bedroom. Use a window as an alternate exit, but make sure the window can be operated easily. If it’s painted shut or blocked by a permanent screen, it's not an exit.</li>
<li>Draw a floor plan of your home. Every room, all levels.</li>
<li>Include all windows and doors, as well as outdoor features, such as trees, shrubs and driveway.</li>
<li>Indicate primary (doors) and secondary (windows) exits from each room on the floor plan.</li>
<li>Choose a designated meeting spot outside your house and mark it on the map. Try to choose a spot in the front yard, since the fire department usually arrives at the front of the house.</li>
<li>Locate a fire alarm box, if one’s available, or designate a family member who'll go to a neighbor’s house to call the fire department.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Family discussion</h2>

Go over the escape plan with each family member. Make sure it’s completely understood, especially by the children. Train them to follow the plan.

Now, walk through the plan. Locate the escape routes in each room. This is a good way to double check your map for errors, too.

Also, have the entire plan checked by your local fire department. You can usually have this done in your home, while the fire department representative makes a simple, free fire safety check. Give them a call. Your kids will enjoy the visit and remember the information.

<h2>Time for a test</h2>

Now that you’ve established your escape plan and had it checked, test it out. Stage a fire drill. Make the drill realistic, without rushing through it. You're trying to make sure everyone knows what to do, not see who finishes first.

Hold a fire drill at least once every six months. Vary the location of the “fire,” so you’ll have to practice using both primary and secondary exits. Change your plan, as your needs change. An escape route that seemed impossible to a child six months ago, may now be handled easily.

<h2>Fire protection equipment</h2>

Recognizing and correcting fire hazards and developing an escape plan is two-thirds of the job of protecting your family. The final step is to create a kit that contains the proper safety equipment.

Without this equipment, you may never be able to put your plan into action.

<h3>Assemble a kit</h3>

A complete kit isn’t on the market, yet. But, you can put one together yourself. Here’s what it should contain:

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/fire-hazard-protection-equipment.jpg" alt="" width="765" height="362" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1167" />

<ul>
<li><strong>Smoke detectors</strong>. One is not enough. NFPA recommends one outside of each bedroom, or sleeping area. Each level of the house should have a smoke detector. Other areas where a smoke detector should be considered are a workshop, living room, dining room and basement. Location is also important. NFPA recommends the following:
<ol>
<li>Locate near sleeping areas.</li>
<li>Install on the ceiling or high on a wall (The preferred location is the center of the ceiling, ceiling at the top of a stairway, or the highest point on a sloped ceiling. Wall mount should be 4 to 12 inches from the ceiling.</li>
<li>Never locate in a comer, or “dead-air" space.</li>
<li>Test the location before final installation. Every family member should be able to hear the alarm loud and clear.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Fire extinguishers</strong>. Again, you may need more than one. One should be located in the kitchen, the number one place for a fire to start. Another good area is the workshop. Learn the correct procedure for operating. by following the instructions on the extinguisher.</li>
<li><strong>Flashlight</strong>. Keep the flashlight readily available, such as on a night stand. Check the batteries regularly or get a plug-in rechargeable flashlight.</li>
<li><strong>Escape route</strong>. Review the escape routes at least every six months. Make changes if your needs change.</li>
<li><strong>Safety ladder</strong>. If you live in a multi-level home, and your secondary escape route is an upper story window, an escape ladder is recommended. They’re designed to attach over the window sill and provide an exit via the window. A word of warning, if you’ve never climbed on one before, try it before you’d have to use it. It can be a little tricky.</li>

		<title>Build your own Yard Shed (with pictures, plans, and a detailed step-by-step)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's buried in there somewhere, deep in the trackless wilderness of your garage.

You vault the lawn mower, ﬁght off the garden hose, narrowly escape being impaled by a ﬁshing pole, to emerge triumphantly — fugitive rake in hand.

Wouldn't it be terriﬁc to avoid all that? To have a separate place to store the mowers, blowers, trimmers, tillers, ladders, sporting gear and other trappings of our busy do-it-ourselves lives? A yard shed is a perfect solution.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1182" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/yard-shed-1-overview-814x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="701" />

Building a shed is cheaper than expanding the garage, a lot more convenient than hauling stuff out of the basement, and safer than leaving your tools and treasures outside. Best of all, though, a yard shed puts everything right where you need it — in the yard. Heck, you could probably clear out enough space to actually ﬁt a car in your garage again.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1187" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/yard-shed-a-overview-1024x935.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="509" />
<h2>Step-by-step construction</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>Position the concrete form, then level and nail it to stakes driven firmly into the ground. Cross braces keep the form square and straight.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1190" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/yard-shed-step-01.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="486" />
<ol start="2">
 	<li>Dig out and level the area for the concrete slab and dig holes for the eave post footings. Strings and batter boards locate the footings.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1191" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/yard-shed-step-02.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="396" />
<ol start="3">
 	<li>Level the concrete as you pour it into the form. Criss-crossed reinforcement rods in the slab and footing strengthen the concrete.</li>
 	<li>Float the concrete to even out high and low spots and further smooth the surface. Small ridges that remain are removed by hand traweling.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1192" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/yard-shed-step-03-04-1024x428.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="233" />
<ol start="5">
 	<li>Trowel the concrete as it sets up and hardens. Anchor bolts, installed while the concrete is still wet, will secure walls to the slab.</li>
 	<li>Mark the nailing plates in pairs to indicate the location of studs, doors, and windows. The bottom plate must be made of treated lumber.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1193" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/yard-shed-step-05-06.jpg" alt="" width="1019" height="456" />
<ol start="7">
 	<li>Nail walls together with 16d nails. Make certain the rough openings for windows and doors are the right size for the windows and doors you plan to use.</li>
 	<li>Nail on top plates to tie the corners together. Cross braces (reused from the concrete form) hold walls plumb and straight until you apply the siding.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1194" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/yard-shed-step-07-08-1024x476.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="259" />
<ol start="9">
 	<li>Install the ridge board on top of the support post. Decorative end cuts are quick and easy to make with a jigsaw.</li>
 	<li>Install eave beams and posts, then plumb and brace them. The narrower center member provides extra strength without looking boxy.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1195" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/yard-shed-step-09-10-1024x422.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="230" />
<ol start="11">
 	<li>Cut rafters. One angled peak cut, two birds-mouth cuts, and one decorative tail cut are required per rafter. Use one rafter as a pattern for the rest.</li>
 	<li>Nail rafters in place, installing the gable-end ones first. Rafters are spaced every 2 ft. and toenailed to beam and wall with 16d nails.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1196" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/yard-shed-step-11-12.jpg" alt="" width="812" height="507" />
<ol start="13">
 	<li>Install plywood roof sheathing, trimming excess plywood after nailing. Stagger end joints and nail securely with 8d nails.</li>
 	<li>Protect sheets of plywood from moisture and humidity with 1x2 cedar on the gable ends and metal Z-flashing at eaves.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1197" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/yard-shed-step-13-14.jpg" alt="" width="816" height="466" />
<ol start="15">
 	<li>Nail shingles over tar paper. Stagger the shingles and fasten them according to manufacturer's directions on the wrapper.</li>
 	<li>Install skylights, embedding them in roofing tar. Skylights located near the peak of the roof let in the most light.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1198" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/yard-shed-step-15-16.jpg" alt="" width="810" height="406" />
<ol start="17">
 	<li>Install ridge cap. Individual shingle tabs with cut-off corners overlap one another to waterproof the ridge and give a finished appearance.</li>
 	<li>Mark siding to fit around rafter tails while sheets are temporarily tacked in position. Use a jigsaw to carefully cut out the notches.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1199" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/yard-shed-step-17-18.jpg" alt="" width="802" height="402" />
<ol start="19">
 	<li>Install lower siding. Use Z-shaped flashing for weather-tightness where siding changes directions. Blocking at seams adds extra support.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1200" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/yard-shed-step-19-detail.jpg" alt="" width="782" height="415" />
<ol start="20">
 	<li>Install the windows and the cedar window trim. Horizontal 1x6 boards cover the siding seam and Z-flashing.</li>
 	<li>Fasten brackets in place to stabilize posts and beams. Paint, stain or seal all exterior surfaces, and your shed is done.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1201" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/yard-shed-step-20-21.jpg" alt="" width="802" height="454" />
<h2>Is this the shed for you?</h2>
The great feature of this shed is its spacious open eaves.

They double the useful space, with only a small increase in construction cost and labor. The eaves provide a protected space for storing those oddball items — ﬁrewood, canoe, utility trailer, lawn furniture or rabbit pen. They also provide space for those oddball activities — reﬁnishing furniture, washing the dog, or just resting your weary bones.

However, if you don’t need or don’t have room for the eaves, you can easily eliminate one or both of them. Simply end the roof rafters a foot or two past the shed walls, and eliminate the support posts, beam, and footings.

With both eaves, this shed requires a space at least 16x 27 ft; with one eave, 16 x 21 ft.; and with no eaves, 16 x 15 ft. The enclosed space is 12 x 12 ft.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1188" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/yard-shed-b-dimensions.jpg" alt="" width="776" height="536" />

This shed is a lot fancier than the barn-shaped or prefab metal units available through home centers and other dealers. We endured plenty of quips about the “gingerbread shack” we were building, but, heck, just pulling a lawnmower out of a shed that looks this lighthearted seems to make the job go easier. The frills are really just a little extra paint and a little extra cutting with the jigsaw — not much time or money — and underneath, it’s a hard-working, long-lasting shed.

If you prefer a simpler look, you can modify the design by simplifying the rafter and beam.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1189" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/yard-shed-c-brackets-and-d-rafter-beam.jpg" alt="" width="747" height="406" />
<h2>Dollars and sense</h2>
The materials for our yard shed, including concrete, framing materials, siding and trim, rooﬁng, windows, skylights, and fasteners, cost $5,200. Additional costs included $200 for the building permit and $350 for paint. If you decide to have the concrete slab professionally poured, plan to spend an extra $750 - $900. We went all the way with our shed and put pavers and rock under the open eaves, which cost another $1,500. Although far from essential, these materials keep the mud and dirt at bay.

You could save money by substituting treated pine for the cedar, eliminating windows, and leaving off an eave or two, but be prepared to spend at least $4,600 for a shed of this size and quality.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1184" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/yard-shed-3-workbench.jpg" alt="" width="809" height="752" />

This is an intermediate to advanced-level project that will test all your DIY knowledge and perseverance. You’re basically building a small house — starting with the concrete floor, working your way up through the wall and roof framing, and capping it off with shingles. You should be prepared to spend a good chunk of your summer spare time wearing a tool belt. Even an ambitious, well-seasoned DIYer will spend a solid weekend laying out and excavating the site; another weekend pouring the slab; and at least 100 hours building the framework, installing siding and shingles, building the doors and adding the trim.

Some tasks, such as lifting the walls into place, installing the roof rafters and hefting plywood onto the roof, require a helper — don’t try to be a hero by doing it alone. You’ll be working at heights, too, so use roof brackets (Photo 13) and good ladder sense.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1186" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/yard-shed-5-eaves-storage.jpg" alt="" width="834" height="802" />
<h2>Tools and Materials</h2>
You’ll need a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-circular-saw/">circular saw</a>, <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-drill-driver-kit/">cordless drill</a>, jigsaw and a hefty 12-gauge extension cord if you‘re running power more than 50 ft. A hammer, chalk line, 4-ft. level and square are mandatory hand tools. You’ll want to invest $20 in a pair of roof brackets (Photo 13). and have an 8-ft. stepladder and short extension ladder available For me, safety glasses and hearing protectors are as important as any other tool listed here — buy them and wear them.

All of the lumber in this project remains exposed, so pick nice straight boards. Use treated or cedar lumber wherever recommended, and paint or seal the non-treated materials to protect them from the elements. Use galvanized nails and screws, too.

[table id=23 responsive=collapse /]
<h2>Planning and permits</h2>
Check with your local building inspector to determine property line setback requirements (5 to 15 ft. are common). Get information on the maximum size and height of outbuildings and find out if there are any protective covenants (special neighborhood regulations) that might affect your project.

Earthquakes, termites, and frost depth are regional factors that may require you to modify this design. Consult your local building inspector for details. A building permit can take as long as a month to obtain — longer if you need to apply for a variance — so, get rolling early.
<h2>Site preparation and excavation</h2>
The best location for your shed is one that's ﬂat and out of the path of any water runoff. You can level a hilly site, but the excavation will be expensive, labor-intensive or both. Build a 12 x 12-ft. concrete form from 2x4 lumber, then square and brace it (Photo 1). Move the entire form around until you're certain you have space for the eave areas, then level and stake the form securely (Photo 2) Dig the perimeter trench as shown in Fig. A, then level the rest of the area to a depth 4 in. below the top of the form.

Stretch strings between batter boards (Photo 2) to determine the location of the eave post footings. Dig these footings to the appropriate frost depth for your area using a posthole digger and shovel, then tamp the bottom of the hole ﬁrmly with the end of a 2x4.
<h2>Pouring the concrete slab</h2>
Pouring a concrete slab is hard, heavy work, and unlike carpentry, where you can pull a few nails to correct a mistake, goof-ups in concrete are, well, set in concrete.

Working with concrete is mostly a process of progressive leveling and smoothing. Concrete is poured into the form, then roughly leveled even with the top with a long, straight 2x4, called a “screed” (Photo 3). The concrete is further leveled and smoothed with a bull ﬂoat (Photo 4), a hand ﬂoat, and ﬁnally a ﬁnishing trowel (Photo 5).

As much as I champion the “roll up your sleeves and give it a whirl” attitude, I feel a project this large is not the place to begin your concrete career. Your shed will be only as useful and longlasting as the slab it rests on. Hire a reputable professional — one familiar with the soil and weather conditions that will affect your slab. Keep in mind the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Take care of the “grunt work” yourself, so contractor bids are for the skilled work only. You can level and stake the forms, excavate and supply muscle power during the concrete pour. But let the pros order the concrete, place the rebar and anchor bolts, orchestrate the actual pour, and do the actual leveling and ﬁnishing of the concrete.</li>
 	<li>If you have a perfect yard shed location but can’t get a concrete truck to it, use a wheelbarrow. That’s what we did. It’s a lot of hard work — three strong backs each made 12 trips over the course of an hour. And it will cost you more — concrete ﬁrms charge a fee for excessively long waits.</li>
 	<li>Use reinforcement rods (Fig. A) to strengthen your slab. Then install three anchor bolts per wall while the concrete is wet — one a foot in from each corner, the other centered. Make sure you don’t put one in the door opening.</li>
 	<li>A smooth concrete surface is the easiest to sweep and keep clean, but a broom ﬁnish or slightly textured surface is less slippery, especially when wet or oily.</li>
 	<li>Concrete needs to cure and harden slowly. You’ll need to cover it with plastic, keep it moist, and wait at least two or three days before removing the forms or beginning carpentry work. Again, when in doubt, consult your concrete contractor.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Framing Walls</h2>
You’ve shoveled dirt, hauled concrete, used a lot of Bengay and now it’s time for the payoff — building the walls.

Cut four pairs of nailing plates (Photo 6) to length. Each pair consists of a bottom plate. which should be pressure-treated lumber, and a top plate, which is not. Position each bottom plate on the edges of the slab, and drill it to ﬁt over the anchor bolts (Photo 6). Mark the location of the studs, windows, and doors on each pair of plates. Studs should be positioned every 16 in.

These window-opening measurements are for the particular sliding windows used, but you can use any make or style window you like. This project uses self-built doors (Fig. A), designed to accommodate the largest resident of this shed, a riding lawn mower. You could also install manufactured steel double doors, a single door, even an overhead garage door. If you increase the width of a door or window opening, though, make certain you increase the size of the support header above it. Consult your building inspector on the size.

The concrete slab provides a clean, ﬂat surface for nailing your walls together (Photo 7) One by one, separate the pairs of nailing plates, lay studs between the layout marks and secure each stud to the plate with two 16d nails on each end, Install the headers, trimmers, sills, and cripple studs for the windows and doors as shown in Fig. A and Photo 7.

Build all four walls, then with the help of an assistant, erect the walls around the edge of the slab, position the holes in the bottom plates over the anchor bolts and secure them with washers and nuts. Sandwich a thin strip of foam sill sealer or butyl caulk between the bottom plate and concrete slab to provide a weathertight seal (Fig. A). A termite guard may be required in some areas.

Nail the comer studs together, making sure the edges are even. Use your level to plumb each wall, then brace them by nailing a 2x4 diagonally across the inside of each wall as shown in Photo 8. Since the siding, which gives the walls their rigidity, isn't installed until after the roof is complete, make sure you brace all four walls. Add the second top plate to the walls, overlapping the wall comers to tie them ﬁrmly together. Install two permanent cross-ties, parallel to the rafters, to prevent the walls from bulging out (Fig. B).
<h2>Roof framing and sheathing</h2>
Install the ridge board (Photo 9) and the three-member eave posts and beams (Photo 10). The center members of the beams and posts are inset 1 in. to avoid a boxy look. There are three important measurements shown in Figs. A and B — ones you must follow for your rafters to ﬁt:
<ol>
 	<li>The distance between the framework of your 2x4 walls and the outside of your eave beam must be 6 ft.</li>
 	<li>The top of your ridge board must be 28-1/4 in. above the top of your shed walls.</li>
 	<li>The top of your eave beam must be 24in. below the top of your shed walls.
<ul>
 	<li>(Tip: Run a straight board with a level attached from the top of the shed wall over to a temporary post resting on each concrete post pad. Then measure down 29-1/2 in, (the 24in. drop plus the 5-1/2 in. depth of the beam) to get the correct post height)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
You can alter these dimensions to ﬁt your design, but if you change one, you will have to change the others.

Plumb and brace the posts in both directions until the rafters are installed. Make layout marks for the rafters 2 ft. apart, center to center, along the ridge, walls, and beams. Fly rafters (Fig. B) are located 16 in. outside the walls.

Next, cut your rafters. Select the straightest 2x6 and cut it to the rafter dimension shown in Fig A. There are four cuts per rafter: the angled peak cut, the two triangular “birds-mouth” cuts (where the rafter rests on the wall and beam) and the curved tail out. Cut the birds-mouths by cutting to the line with a circular saw and ﬁnishing the cut with a jigsaw or handsaw (Photo 11).

After cutting the ﬁrst rafter, set it in place on both sides of both gable ends to check for a snug ﬁt. Use this ﬁrst rafter as a pattern to cut the remaining ones. (Don’t cut the wall top birds-mouth in the four ﬂy rafters.) Secure the two rafters at each gable end ﬁrst, using 16d nails, then install the remaining rafters in opposing pairs (Photo 12).

To establish a straight line for laying the roof plywood, snap a chalk line near the eave end of the rafters. This project leaves 8 in of the rafter ends exposed, but you could also cover the rafters all the way to the ends.

Here are two tips:
<ul>
 	<li>Use 5/ 8-in. plywood rather than the normal 1/2-in. if you want to avoid the tips of the 3/4-in. rooﬁng nails from being visible from below.</li>
 	<li>Paint the underside of the plywood before installation, so you don’t have to do it later.</li>
</ul>
Stagger the end joints of your plywood (Photo 13) as you install the sheets. and nail the plywood ﬁrmly to each rafter with 8d nails, spaced 6 in. apart (Fig. B.) Use a chalk line to mark any overhanging plywood and use a circular saw to trim it after it's nailed down. Cover the exposed edges with ﬂashing and cedar strips (Photo 14) before shingling.
<h2>Shingling</h2>
As always. use caution when working on a roof. Staple tar paper down over the entire roof right away. to protect your project from the rain. Horizontal tar paper seams should overlap by at least 3 in, and end-to-end seams by 6 in. Take care to lay the tar paper parallel to the ridge so it can be used as a guide for laying the shingles. The best shingling instructions I know of comes right on most shingle wrappers — follow them. Tread lightly on your installed shingles: In cold weather they’re brittle; in warm weather, they’re hot and gooey.

Skylights are optional but really brighten the interior. This project used inexpensive (around $75) plastic skylights available through most home centers. It took an extra hour to install each skylight and shingles around it. Skylights let in plenty of heat, too — you may want to install vents at gable ends for summer cooling.

Waterproof the ridge and give it a neat ﬁnished look by installing the ridge cap (Photo 17). Trim the upper comers of the individual tabs, then overlap the pieces as you nail them along the ridge. Snap a chalk line beforehand to keep your ridge cap straight.
<h2>Siding, Windows, and Doors</h2>
This project uses 4 by 8-ft. sheets of T1-11 (Photo 18) siding for a number of reasons. First. it doubles as both structural sheathing and siding, eliminating the need to use plywood underneath. T1-11 is relatively inexpensive and by simply changing the direction of the grooves, it makes an interesting design at a bargain rate. Finally, the large sheets made it easier to notch, then slide the siding around the rafters (Photo 18), so it wasn’t necessary to cut separate blocks to ﬁt between the rafters.

Mark and cut the upper sheets of siding that ﬁt around the rafter tails ﬁrst. Next, tuck in the Z-ﬂashing (Fig. E) and install the lower vertical siding (Photo 19). Before siding the gable ends, ﬁll in the space between the rafters and Wall tops with short cripple studs (Fig A).

Install the windows, cedar corner boards, and horizontal 1x6s. The curved brackets installed in Photo 21 are cute, but also structural — they brace the eave posts and beams. You can change the bracket design (Fig. C), but make sure you leave some form of a solid triangle between post and beam.

Construct the doors as shown in Fig. A and install them. A standard door sweep will help seal the gap between the door bottom and the concrete slab from wind and water.
<h2>Painting and maintenance</h2>
Save a ton of time and energy by using a roller to paint the underside of your roof plywood and the back side of your siding <strong>before</strong> installing it. I cut and tacked my cedar trim in place to assure a tight ﬁt, then removed it, painted it and nailed it up for good. Use caulk to seal any gaps. I coated the ﬂoor with a paint made speciﬁcally for concrete ﬂoors to help seal moisture out and make cleanups easier.

Hornets and other pests will love the open eaves of your shed almost as much as you do. An occasional spraying with a garden hose should help control the insect population.
<h2>Organizing and using your shed</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1185" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/yard-shed-4-storage-space.jpg" alt="" width="742" height="1022" />

You built this shed to conquer clutter, so here are some additional tips to help you win the battle:
<ul>
 	<li>Determine what activities and equipment your shed will contain before you start building. This will help you ﬁnd the best placement of doors, windows, benches, etc.</li>
 	<li>Make a sketch before you build, showing the position of large items like workbenches, riding and push mowers, snow blowers and cabinets, then plan and build storage cabinets and shelves to ﬁt around them.</li>
 	<li>Use every square inch of your shed. The rafter space can store light, infrequently used items; the cavities between the studs can hold lumber; even the backs of your double doors can provide a convenient place to hang shovels and brooms.</li>
 	<li>Take advantage of the great, low-maintenance workshop and closet organizers on the market today. Roll-out baskets, stackable bins, shelving systems and hooks are easy to install and ready to go to work.</li>
</ul>
Proper planning will turn your yard shed into a real DIYer’s castle.

		<title>Lower Fuel Bills with a Blower Door Test</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is the blower door test?</h2>

<strong>The blower door test measures air leakage in a house.</strong>

With the fan on and the pressure gauge steady, the volume of air blowing out equals the amount leaking in.

The blower door apparatus is composed of a wooden frame covered with an airtight nylon fabric, which is fit snugly into the frame of the open back door. Then the technician attaches a large cylinder, which enclosed a fan, into an opening in the fabric.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/blower-door-test-air-flow.jpg" alt="" width="772" height="793" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1238" />

<h2>What does the thermogram do during a blower door test?</h2>

<strong>A thermogram detects the temperature of the inside wall. Cool surfaces appear dark, and warm surfaces are light.</strong>

On a cool day, wood framing is cooler than insulation. Windows are cold and so appear dark. Notice the cool area around the light fixture where air leaks in. Cool attic air also can leak down a stud cavity to the electric outlet, probably due to a hole drilled for the wire.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/blower-door-test-thermogram.jpg" alt="" width="998" height="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1239" />

<h2>How does a blower door test work?</h2>

The fan takes air from the house and blows it out the door, reducing the air pressure inside. One the technician switches on the fan, immediately the nylon fabric blocking the doorway bellied inward, as air tries to get back inside.

Of course, with the pressure reduced inside, outside air will leak in through whatever cracks it can find — around windows, through cracks in the sheathing, under weather stripping, and so on.

That’s why you <a href="https://www.thisoldhouse.com/how-to/preparing-home-blower-door-test">close all the doors and windows</a>. Also turn off the furnace and water heater and seal off their exhaust flues, so there is no air being drawn back down the chimney (called back-drafting).

Even with the house closed up tightly, the fan continues to blow air out. Obviously, air has to be leaking in from somewhere — probably from many small gaps. The goal isn’t to close up every leak, just to bring the leakage down to 15 hundredths (.15) of an air change per hour (acph).

To get an idea of what one air change is, imagine all the air in your home suddenly pumped away and then replaced by fresh outside air. In the average American home, that much air leaks in and out every hour. It’s about the same as having a large window wide open all the time!

If you go below .35 acph, your home can get too tight and the inside air can become stale and loaded with pollutants. Though energy efficient homes can and do go much lower, they all must run a ventilating fan continuously to keep the air inside fresh, just as commercial buildings do.

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blower_door">blower door test equipment</a> has two types of gauges. One type measures the air pressure in the house, and the other tells how much air the fan draws out – in other words, how fast air is leaking back in. By changing the fan speed, the technician increases or decreases the pressure and compares the leakage rate at each pressure. Then a special computer software tells how tight the house is.

<h2>How does the thermogram work?</h2>

The thermogram is a heavy black instrument that looks like a fat, old-time home movie camera. It allows the technician see into your home’s walls and ceilings. Only that instead of seeing see light, it sees heat.

Every object radiates heat waves, a different wavelength for each temperature. The camera senses those wavelengths and outlines the objects on a small screen according to their temperature, sort of a video thermometer.

If you put your hand on a wall for five seconds and heat the wallboard a few degrees, it will show through the camera from the opposite side of the room – a bright “heat print” shaped like a hand on the cooler wall. Like magic. You can see the wall studs clearly behind the wallboard. too. The camera renders the cooler areas dark and the warmer areas light. Wood doesn't insulate as well as fiberglass or other insulation, so the studs draw heat from the room faster, cooling the drywall where it touches them.

For this camera to work well, the temperature outside must be at least 10 degrees cooler or warmer than inside. Otherwise, the temperature differences are so small that you can’t find the problem spots.

The picture above was taken on a cool day, so as cool air leaks in, it cools nearby surfaces and shows up as dark areas on the camera screen. Air leakage is easy to spot.

<h2>About home air tightness</h2>

When the technician snapped open a suitcase he had set on the kitchen floor near the back door, you had to be impressed. In it were four large, round, black and white gauges that looked like clocks with red hands. It also contained a small computer, a variety of switches, plus coils of clear tubing. From his hardware you might suspect that he was a government agent sent to electronically eavesdrop on some household secrets. While he isn't a government agent, his <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/blower-door-tests">blower door test</a> instruments are calibrated to reveal a mystery about this house — how much air leaks in and out through its walls and ceilings.

Frankly. few people cared how tightly their house was built in the 1950s or 1960s, unless winter drafts froze their socks. You could always crank up the heat a little higher. But fuel bills have gone up, and homeowners don't want to waste a penny of their budget. New homes are the result of several years of dreaming and careful planning. People might skip the hardwood floors and several other features at a first stage, opting to put their bucks into a special energy-efficiency package offered by a savvy building contractor. These packages guarantee good insulation and a minimum leakage rate (air-tightness). The reasoning is simple: save on fuel bills and buy other features later with the money saved.

The deal also includes a special ventilation system, to assure a good supply of fresh air. More on this later. Though the energy package promised to be a good deal, new homeowners face a perplexing problem. How can they know if it worked? They could measure the insulation thickness, but there's no easy way to gauge air leakage. And that's not a small item: in the average new home. leakage accounts for a whopping 25-50 percent of the fuel bill.

That’s where a professional thermographer comes in. His job is to map heat movement in homes. The instruments pulled from that suitcase are for a blower door test. which measures the air leakage rate of the house and will determine if the contractor has met the terms promised in the contract.

These professionals are usually passionate about energy conservation and enjoy working with clients interested in energy-efficient homes. Heating bills over the most frigid of winters can be greatly reduced, and I’m not talking “superinsulation” or unusual design either. Savvy contractors build homes to meet the local energy code, and also make a special effort to make them more airtight.

It is common for a house to fail its first test. Even homes done by the best contractors often fail at first, because the airtightness standards are tough to meet. In fact, contractors depend on pros to pin-point the worst leaks so they can plug them.

Usually people don’t know or care much about what goes on behind the walls of their homes before deciding to buy one of these energy-efficient home packages. The payoff they want was those low heating bills in the middle of the cold winters.

The thermogram easily shows gaps in the insulation (which also would show up as dark areas), a good sign that the insulating crew worked carefully.

It also allows to find several major leaks. One type of common air leak involves recessed lights in the ceiling below the attic. That’s called an “attic by-pass" (an air gap that leads through the ceiling into the attic). All you need is to have electricians cutting through the ceiling to install lights, insulators that failed to seal the fixtures, and a distracted contractor who didn’t check these compounded mistakes.

(By the way, sealing recessed light fixtures is both a common problem and a tricky job. Insulating and sealing the wrong type can cause the fixture to overheat and start a fire. Always ask an electrical inspector or an electrician to check your work to make sure you followed a safe insulating procedure.)

Another problematic area is the exterior framing, which allows air to leak around the lights into the ceiling area. 

Keep in mind that even with ceiling leaks, a home can pass the airtightness test quite easily.

Energy-efficient homes are already a present necessity. Finding a trained and certified thermographer can be easy – use the internet or ask your local utility, insulation contractors, or your state and federal energy agencies for information.

The training element is vital; it's much more than reading a few dials and plugging numbers into a computer. Home safety is the key ingredient. The first thing a good technician does when entering a home is to set up a carbon monoxide (CO) monitor near the furnace and water heater. Poorly adjusted or worn-out combustion appliances can leak C0, a deadly gas, into the living space Serious professionals check for this danger right away.

And before leaving a job, responsible technicians check both the furnace and water heater for backdrafting.

<h2>What is backdrafting?</h2>

<strong>Backdrafting is caused when a home doesn't have enough incoming air to allow exhaust fumes to rise naturally up and out the chimney. Rather, your house can draw air down the chimney instead, causing the deadly fumes to spill inside. That is a big concern. While there are no official statistics about this issue, it is estimated that backdrafting can be found in 1 house out of every 5.</strong>

Backdrafting can be a problem in tight homes because they often have unbalanced ventilation. Kitchen and bathroom fans can blow air out faster than replacement air leaks in. That can cause the natural upward draft in the chimney to reverse.

A balanced ventilation system happens when your home has a well dimensioned, continuously running blower. Not only does it expel stale inside air, but it also draws in exactly the same amount of air, so the pressure inside remains the same. In other words, can’t cause backdrafting.

Modern ventilation systems have an additional energy-saving feature – an air-to-air heat exchanger, which uses the warm outgoing air to heat the cooler incoming air. It wastes less heat while ensuring good ventilation.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Do I need Gutters in my home?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Are gutters required?

Some people say gutters are a must, others say you can get by without them. Even though sometimes keeping clean gutters is a year-round chore, sometimes gutters are 100% necessary.

I asked a home inspector friend, and he’d always choose to have gutters whenever having the option. Here’s why.

<a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/wet-basement/">Wet basements</a> are a common problem in many areas of the country. A great majority of the problems can be cured by controlling the rainwater, starting at the gutters, continuing to the downspouts with splash blocks under them to carry the water away from the house and ﬁnally, followed by grading, so the earth slopes away from the house for several feet.

The illustration on the left shows a house where gutters may not be needed. The slope, or grade, is designed to carry water away from the foundation. If the water isn't allowed to pool and stay near the house, the basement will almost always stay dry.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1258" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gutters-required.jpg" alt="" width="679" height="298" />

The illustration on the right may seem extreme, but there are homes out there with just this type of “reverse” grade or slope. The grade runs toward the house, which would allow water to pool next to the foundation. Here, gutters are a must.

You should also check some other homes in the area. Find homes with gutters and without. Talk to the owners and ask them if they have experienced any water problems.

If you do go with gutters, I’d recommend installing gutter screens to keep debris out and probably use one of the new plastic types, which have self-cleaning downspouts. If you don't, I’d suggest you build in a way so you can install them later, if you change your mind.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Some older houses have ceramic tile ﬂoors over a cement slab in their rooms. Sometimes the floor may crack over the entire length of the room. If you want to replace the tile, you might be asking yourself how to prevent the tile from cracking again.

<strong>If you have a crack that runs the entire length of a room in a relatively straight line, the problem is not in the tile, but in the subfloor. Any movement in the underlying subﬂoor will crack ceramic tiles. Cracks like these are almost always found over a joint in the cement slab.</strong>

Remove your cracked tiles and see if there is a "cold" (or "control") joint in the slab or if the slab was done in two pours. A cold joint will look like the joints you see in sidewalks and is there to relieve stress. If the slab was poured in two pours, you will see an almost perfectly straight crack, and the color of the cement may vary slightly from one side to the other.

Tiles laid over a joint or crack in the subﬂoor will have a tendency to crack, but if you're nailing, there are steps you can take to cut down the chances of it happening again.

If there is a joint in the slab, it should be an expansion joint. Make a 1/4-in. to 1/2-in. wide cut through the slab at the joint (use a rented concrete saw) and fill the cut with silicone caulk or asphalt-impregnated expansion joint filler.

Next, when you lay out your tile, make sure that no tiles straddle the joint. When you grout, don’t use regular grout over the expansion joint. Instead, use a caulk labeled specifically for tile floors (available from tile dealers). This will give you a joint that will take some movement without cracking.

If the cracked tiles are not over a joint, it means that your floor settled at some time, causing the tiles to crack. As long as the floor isn't actively settling, you can usually safely retile without having to worry about further cracking.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Get Fresh Air Indoors During The Winter</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-494" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Fresh-Air-Circulation-During-The-Winter.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="200" />

<a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/blower-door-test/">Ventilating your home</a> is always easier during the summer, which is why the majority of people do not pay attention to it - they simply open their windows. As the weather gets cooler, fresh air circulation is greatly reduced because people pay more attention to keeping their homes warm, instead of renewing the stale air.

Those factors lead to a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/check-carbon-monoxide-at-home/">decrease in air quality indoors</a> since emphasis goes to keeping warmer temperatures. However, it is simple to take a few steps and ensure high air quality standards and keep your home warm, both at the same time.

Keep on reading to understand how to achieve the best of both worlds at your own home during this winter.
<h2>1. Keep Your HVAC System Clean</h2>
Instead of having your dust recirculating through your HVAC vents and registers, get rid of the residue build-up within your HVAC unit.

All you have to do is to get your vacuum cleaner and use its wand attachment to significantly decrease the dust blowing indoors. Studies about indoor air quality claim that this is the first step to immediately improve the air quality at your home.
<h2>2. Use A Humidifier</h2>
When the heat is running, the indoor air gets dryer, which encourages you to turn up the heat because dry air does not feel as warm as humid air. So, use a humidifier to moisten your indoor air.

Humidifiers are not that expensive to buy, plus they will allow you to save some money by not turning up the heat so much during the winter, effectively saving you some money on utility bills.
<h2>3. Air Filter Replacement</h2>
Check your air filters for debris and dirt on a monthly basis - and remember that this is an important task to be done throughout the year. Replace them if necessary.

If you have pets or live near a construction site, you will need to change your filters more often. Also, keep in mind that filters clog up faster during winter because there is less air circulating, which decreases your system's efficiency.

There is no rule of thumb here as to how often to change your air filters because each home is different, so you need to pay attention and check them at least once a month. A good tip is to place a monthly reminder on my mobile phone, so you can remember to check out your own filters.
<h2>4. Crack Open Windows</h2>
Regardless of the outside temperature, even a small amount of fresh air can make a big difference when there is little to no air renewal. Obviously, do not leave your windows open for too long because that will cause your furnace to work harder unnecessarily.

Ideally, crack a window or two for a few moments every day and keep renewing the air inside your home frequently. The morning air is usually fresher, plus mornings tend to be sunnier as well, so that is a good moment to crack open your windows.
<h2>4. Get Green Houseplants</h2>
Lush and green houseplants can do a lot in terms of removing carbon monoxide and benzene for your indoor air, and that automatically improves air quality.

Houseplants are a great investment in your wellness, regardless of what season we are in - they always add style and life to any room, as well as decoration. Some studies affirm that houseplants even reduce stress, which is another reason why you should consider adding a few indoor houseplants to your home.
<h2>5. Regular Maintenance And Servicing Are Important</h2>
Your furnace is an essential part of ensuring your indoor air quality.

Wise homeowners perform regular servicing with a professional, as this person is experienced in removing all dirt, debris, and dust accumulated inside your furnace. A professional will also tune-up and decontaminate your entire system, which ensures efficient operation and use less energy.

Using less energy means lower utility bills, saving you money in the process. An efficient system also brings an increased comfort level. Make sure to only hire services from a reputable HVAC company in your area for your yearly furnace tune-up.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Poor indoor air quality does not have to be a problem for you and your family.

Hiring the services of a professional HVAC company with NATE certified contractors can ensure your system is always clean and well maintained. This service will also bring you savings in utility bills and a system that lasts longer. Not to mention the extra comfort from breathing better air.

A good company will also make specific suggestions on how to improve your home system in order to ensure better indoor air quality, especially if someone in your home has respiratory issues.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is ugly, awkward, dirty work, but if you do it right, you won’t have to think about it again for a long, long time.

I can’t promise you a swift, clean repair when it comes to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soffit">soffits</a>, but I guarantee you’ll become intimate (perhaps a lot more than you'd like!) with an often ignored part of your home.
<h2>Step by step Soffit Repair instructions</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>Rent a rolling scaffold for soffit repair work. The jacks adjust to the slope of your yard, and the plywood pads keep the wheels from sinking.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1205" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/soffit-repair-1.jpg" alt="" width="515" height="487" />
<ol start="2">
 	<li>Pull the nails with a pry bar to release the gutter straps and lower the gutter. This job is easier if you have a helper.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1206" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/soffit-repair-2.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="487" />
<ol start="3">
 	<li>Pry the fascia board off the rafter tails if it shows not. You may have to cut badly rusted nails with a hacksaw.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1207" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/soffit-repair-3.jpg" alt="" width="532" height="486" />
<ol start="4">
 	<li>Pry the soffit boards off the lookouts and remove the trim strip (sometimes called a “frieze board”). Wear a dust mask; this can be dirty work.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1208" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/soffit-repair-4.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="487" />
<ol start="5">
 	<li>Probe the rotted areas with a screwdriver to find the extent of the damage. Let moist areas dry out before proceeding.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1209" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/soffit-repair-5.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="487" />
<ol start="6">
 	<li>Screw a new section of rafter to the old one to reinforce the tail. Make the new section twice as long as the rafter tail.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1210" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/soffit-repair-6.jpg" alt="" width="534" height="487" />
<ol start="7">
 	<li>Install new 2x4 lookouts to replace rotted ones or screw a new one to the old one if it’s mostly sound. Install a new fascia board.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1211" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/soffit-repair-7.jpg" alt="" width="515" height="492" />
<ol start="8">
 	<li>Insert a strip vent (or other vents) in the new soffit to ventilate the attic and roof. Use galvanized finish nails to fasten the soffit boards.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1212" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/soffit-repair-8.jpg" alt="" width="514" height="488" />
<ol start="9">
 	<li>Cut the last soffit board to fit, then cover the sawn edge with the trim strip. Paint to finish up.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1213" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/soffit-repair-9.jpg" alt="" width="513" height="488" />

Soffits are the narrow band of a ceiling that covers the bottom side of the roof overhang. To the casual eye, they appear decorative. because they come in so many sizes and styles,

But they usually play a bigger role. too. They shade the siding and protect it from bad weather; they help keep rainwater away from the foundation; and, perhaps most important, they provide ventilation to your roof and attic to flush away unwanted moisture and keep the root cooler.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1204" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/soffit-repair-1024x895.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="487" />

When soffits start going bad, you usually get some clear signs. Watch for badly peeling paint or brown stains. Both signal water problems. Wet wood will shed its paint, warp and begin to rot. By the time holes appear, the rot has already advanced pretty far, and you’ll want to get to your repairs right away before things get worse.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1214" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/soffit-repair-wasps.jpg" alt="" width="428" height="351" />
<p class="alert">Oops, bee attack! Check for critters like bees and wasps, which often hang their homes from your soffits.
Soffits, being well-protected from bad weather, make a great home for various critters, especially bees and wasps (including yellow jackets and hornets).
Most are beneficial, the bees pollinating flowers and wasps hunting down other insects until you start hammering near their homes. You sure don't want them buzzing around your head when you’re atop a ladder or scaffold.
If you’re <a href="https://acaai.org/allergies/types/insect-sting-allergies">allergic to stings</a>, take special care here. Check your soffits in advance for nests or signs of bee or wasp activity. You can simply knock smaller nests down with a pole, but wait for nighttime when the insects are less active. For safety, work from the ground and use a flashlight or no light at all so they can’t see you. A spray insecticide that’s formulated for bees works, too.
Even better, do your soffit work during cooler weather, like the fall, when the insects become inactive or die. If the nest is softball size or larger, you’re getting into a big colony and might want to contact a pest control service to remove them.</p>
But that repair doesn’t begin with the soffits. Soffit problems are almost always caused by leaky roots or leaky gutters that ruin the roof edge. Once water seeps through worn shingles or under loose flashings, it‘ll run down rafters or roof boards and puddle on the top side of the soffit boards.

Your first step should be to fix your roof right away, which is not the goal of today’s article. Working on a roof is always dangerous, so you’d better hire a professional roofer to remedy the problem, especially if your roof slope is steep, if you don't feel comfortable working at heights even after taking safety precautions, or if your roof is higher than one story. The roof boards under worn shingles might well have rotted, too. This is the time to replace them as well.

What you will see is how to open up and repair the soffit portion of this job. In this example, a roof leak around a plumbing vent allowed water to run down onto the soffit boards, causing them to warp and rot along with the fascia board. (These parts are labeled on the opening photo.)

First, the leak was stopped, and the necessary roof boards and shingles were replaced. Now we have to remove the rotten soffit boards, check for rot in the structure inside, and patch the soffit back together.

This soffit is just about as bad off as you can find. The soffit boards that have warped and rotted are common on homes built about in the 1940s or 1950s. In this case, it's tough to do a patch job with new boards and make the new blend with the old. So we replaced all the old soffit boards with new 1x4 tongue-and-groove beaded ceiling boards, which you can usually find at a lumberyard for reasonable prices.

The material costs for this project are relatively low compared to the labor cost if you decide to hire a carpenter. If you decide to do it yourself, expect the job to take several days, and expect the work to be dirty and awkward. Though most homeowners are fully capable of the work involved, this isn't a good project for a beginner.

In newer homes where builders used plywood or hardboard for the soffits, the job should go much faster and easier. You can simply remove the damaged panel, carry out the repairs shown, and replace the panel with an identical new one.

Many homeowners choose to cover up soffit problems with maintenance-free aluminum. The paint on aluminum soffits doesn’t peel and the metal won’t corrode or rot, so it’s a sensible choice. While aluminum soffits might not be as attractive as the original wood, once they’re in place you won‘t have to work on those high, awkward and often dangerous roof edges to fix problems and paint.

On the downside, you'll have to keep a sharper eye on the condition of your roof, because the aluminum soffits won't show signs of roof leaks as readily, possibly allowing damage to get much worse and costly before you discover the problem.
<h2>Before you get started</h2>
Though you can work from ladders, there‘s a slick device that can make your soffit work a whole lot easier and safer — the rolling scaffold (opening photo and Photo 1).

One 6-ft. high section puts you up at a comfortable working height for most first-floor roofs, so you don‘t have to bend, stretch and reach as you would from a ladder. The wheels allow you to push the scaffold back and forth along the house and soffit. Just make sure to shove two 3/4-in. plywood pads (12 x 12 in. min.) under each of the four wheels and lock the wheels before climbing up.

Of course, working even a few feet off the ground can be dangerous. Make sure you follow all safety precautions, including fastening a railing on the outside of the scaffold. When you rent the scaffold, ask for full assembly and safety instructions. I suggest you work no higher than the first story, leaving higher work for professionals.

<strong>Caution</strong>: Don't ever touch the power lines that come to your home They can be deadly.
<h2>Repairing the soffit</h2>
Photos 1-9 illustrate a major repair job.

You never know how much work you’ll have on your hands until you remove enough boards to see inside the soffit. Only then will you know whether you need to rent the scaffolding for a day or as long as a week. If you see a lot of rot and broken or severely damaged rafters, you might need some expert <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/new-hobby-woodworking/">carpentry</a> advice, too.

If you‘re lucky, the fascia board will be in good shape. If so, your job is easier. You won’t have to remove either the fascia board or the gutter, and so you can skip Photos 2 and 3.

But if the soffits were in bad shape, chances are that you’ll find rot in the ratter tails and lookouts, too (Photo 5). Both are important parts of your house. The rafter tails support the edge of the roof, and the lookouts support the soffit boards, so they have to be sound.

Our 2x6 rafter tail had rotted enough to weaken it, so we screwed another 2x6 to it (Photo 6). There's no hard and fast rule about when to strengthen a rafter tail. Generally, I do so whenever there’s rot because it’s an easy operation while you have the soffits open. You don’t even have to remove the rotted pan; rot won't spread as long as the rafters remain dry.

Notice in Photo 6 that the new section extends as far above the wall as the rafter tail length. You might have to climb into your attic to fasten it securely, using three screws at the upper end and three others every 16 in.

Replace rotted lookouts so you have a good nailing surface for your new soffit boards (Photo 7).
<h2>Upgrading ventilation</h2>
Fixing this soffit gave us a perfect opportunity to upgrade our attic ventilation (Photos 8 and 9). When originally built, this attic had poor ventilation. The added strip vent allows plenty of air to flow into the attic and out through other vents located near the peak of the roof. Use cardboard or plastic baffles (opening photo) to keep your insulation from blocking the airflow.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You can stop rot easily, but repairing the damage may call for nothing short of surgery.

Unlike typical home ills such as broken windows, fading paint, and sagging doors, infestations of rot in floors aren‘t obvious. You might not even detect the problem until you feel a soft spot in the floor, hear a suspicious squish as you step down, or find your toilet tilting and beginning to rock from side to side You also might see telltale brown stains showing up on the floor surface.

Unfortunately, by this time, the rot has already done some damage, so a complete cure requires two tasks. First, you have to eliminate the conditions that caused it — moisture in wood. And second, you’ll have to replace any weakened wood.
<h2>Step-by-Step: How to Repair a Water-Damaged Subfloor</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>Remove the toilet and other obstructions like the vanity to expose the floor and make work easier.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1218" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rotted-floor-1.jpg" alt="" width="539" height="553" />
<ol start="2">
 	<li>Probe for soft spots in the wood floor with a screwdriver, removing tile as you go, to find the extent of the rot damage.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1219" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rotted-floor-2.jpg" alt="" width="392" height="436" />
<ol start="3">
 	<li>Cut through the vinyl and underlayment along the tub with your power saw, finishing the cut with a chisel at the ends. Then pull up the entire underlayment and vinyl.</li>
 	<li>Probe again with a screwdriver to determine the extent of rot damage to the subfloor. When cutting out the rotten sections, plan the saw cuts so they fall on the center of joists.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1220" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rotted-floor-3-4.jpg" alt="" width="729" height="349" />
<ol start="5">
 	<li>Remove the subfloor section to eliminate all soft, rotting wood. Pull nails before cutting along joists.</li>
 	<li>Allow rotted areas to dry out, then apply a coat of wood preservative to damaged and discolored areas.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1221" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rotted-floor-5-6.jpg" alt="" width="743" height="350" />
<ol start="7">
 	<li>Fasten a 2x4 to the damaged joist with 3-in. galvanized drywall screws to supply a solid, flat nailing surface.</li>
 	<li>Toenail or screw 2x4 blocks to the joists to support the edges of the subfloor and the waste flange.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1222" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rotted-floor-7-8.jpg" alt="" width="744" height="355" />
<ol start="9">
 	<li>Fasten the new subfloor patch in place, screwing all edges, including the old floor, to joists and 2x4 blocks. Use 1-1/2 in. screws spaced every 6 in.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1223" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rotted-floor-9.jpg" alt="" width="626" height="554" />

Your floor can get wet in many ways, but you won't have to worry about most of them. Occasional spills, and puddles left from wet feet and floor washing won't cause trouble. because they soon dry up. Rather, look for sources that regularly wet the floor and never give it a chance to dry out. That’s what causes rot. It most frequently occurs around leaky pipes or drains, showers and bathtubs, and toilets.

You might think that replacing the rotted wood would be easy — just cut out the damage and patch it. But unfortunately, rot usually occurs in hard-to-reach places — under the toilet, next to the vanity, under the kitchen sink or along a wall. The job gets tougher when radiators, sinks or other fixtures have to be moved.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1218" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rotted-floor-1.jpg" alt="" width="539" height="553" />

Complications also increase when rot extends under walls and weakens the supporting structure of your house. If these repairs are beyond your ability, it‘s vital that you call your building inspector and ask how best to proceed.
<h2>Is floor replacement a big job?</h2>
In this story you’ll see how to repair the rotted floor around a toilet. The rot was caused by two moisture sources:
<ol>
 	<li>condensation running off the cool bowl and tank onto the floor during humid summer days, and</li>
 	<li>an old leaky seal between the toilet and its soil pipe (Photo 1).</li>
</ol>
If the signs of moisture around the toilet base were ignored early on and reset the toilet with a new wax ring and solved the tank sweating problem, it would have been possible to avoid trouble. No moisture, no rot. It’s that simple.

But with the damage done, now it’s necessary to tear out and replace the rotted wood floor.

A <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/new-hobby-woodworking/">novice</a> can complete the carpentry in this project with a &lt; a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-circular-saw/"&gt;circular saw, jigsaw, and a &lt; a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/best-cordless-drill/"&gt;1/2 in. variable speed drill for driving screws. You can remove and reset the toilet with an adjustable wrench. Because you’ll be removing the bathroom fixtures, repairing the rot and laying a new floor, you can expect your bathroom to be out of action for about two days.

However, if there are leaks in the toilet drain line (Photo 5) or if it needs replacement, the project will get more complicated. You‘ll need to consult or hire a professional plumber to make sure your drain connections are leak-proof.
<h2>Getting rid of the rot</h2>
To get at the rot problem in this bathroom, it was necessary to remove the vanity and toilet. To do this, first shut off the valves where the water supply pipes emerge from the wall and then disconnect the feed tubes. If your bathroom fixtures don't have valves, shut off the entire house's supply at the water main. Then turn on your sink faucets to allow the water pressure to release, before un-hooking the connections under the sink.

You can remove the toilet by un-screwing the hold-down nuts on either side of the base and lifting it up (Photo 1). Be sure to flush it first, though, to empty the water from the tank, and then sponge out the excess.

With the floor cleared for action, you can now probe it with a screwdriver to find the salt spots and plan your strategy (Photo 2). Most floors have two layers of wood: an underlayment over a subfloor. The subfloor usually runs in a continuous sheet under all the walls. It can’t be removed easily. The underlayment, however, was put in after the walls were up, so it fits each room and is tailored to the type of floor covering being used, The underlayment, therefore, is easy to pull up and remove.

In this case it was decided to replace both the underlayment and the floor tile in the entire bathroom. The tile was in poor shape, the patch would have had to be large, and we couldn’t make a good color match anyway. Plus, it would take too long to smooth and prepare the old underlayment for new tile.

To remove the underlayment, we had to saw through it (but not through the subfloor!) along the tub (Photo 3), since it extended underneath. Then it was raised up with a pry bar.

Removing rot is a dirty business, so put on your gloves when you attack it. Also. stuff a rag into the toilet flange (Photo 4) to keep sewer gas from escaping into your house and to keep debris from falling down the drain,
<h2>Repairing the floor</h2>
With the underlayment gone, you can now assess the damage to the subfloor and remove the rotted section. Working around the toilet flange is always tricky. because you have to shove your new subfloor and underlayment under it to give it adequate support.

If you remove the old flange, though, you'll have to do some complicated plumbing to reinstall it. Use a jigsaw to cut out the circles as shown in Photos 9, 10 and 11 to make the floor fit under the flange.

If you've had a recurring leak, your floor joists might be rotted and weakened, too. In that case, you'll have to insert an entirely new joist and screw it to the solid wood of the old one This can be a big project – you may have to
open more floor to insert the new joist, move electrical or plumbing runs, or raise a sagging floor. If you're unfamiliar with these complications, hire a professional carpenter to help out.

Fortunately, this project’s joist rot caused only minor surface damage. which was repaired by screwing a 2x4 to the joist to provide a sound top edge (Photo 7).

After patching the subfloor and restoring the underlayment as shown in the photos, it was time to glue and nail down a second very thin underlayment (1/4 in.) to assure a perfectly smooth surface for the vinyl floor.

<strong>TIP</strong>: When you buy thin material, make sure you get underlayment-grade plywood, which is better than regular grades.

You’ll get a smoother, stronger floor if you stagger your seams along different joists, so the edges of one layer don‘t fall directly over those of another. Vinyl floors show all faults and irregularities beneath them, so the rough joint between the old and new underlayment along the bathtub would have shown through and looked bad if it weren’t covered. However, other floor coverings, like ceramic tile, won't need that extra 1/4 in. underlayment.

You can’t always get away with adding extra layers to your floor without adjusting the toilet flange, though. In this case the 1/4-in. underlayment was laid around the flange, not underneath, because it wasn’t possible to raise the flange above its old height.

The wax ring put on the toilet still sealed the toilet to the flange, but it wouldn't have if the floor had been built up much higher. This is an important detail to confirm in advance when deciding on your new floor covering.
<h2>Solutions to a sweating toilet</h2>
Next time you see a puddle of water underneath the toilet on a hot and humid day, don't automatically blame your toddler. Check the outside of the tank and toilet to see if "sweat" is running down the sides and onto the floor.

Of course, toilets don’t actually sweat; water doesn’t seep through their impervious glazed-china walls. The beads of water are condensation caused by humid air meeting the cool toilet sides.

Normally the toilet would be at room temperature, the same temperature as air. But when the toilet’s used frequently, cool water from the water supply underground can cool both the tank and bowl. That’s why on a humid summer day you’ll often find beads of “sweat” building up and dripping to the floor. Of course, as the tank and bowl warm to room temperature, the condensation will evaporate.

Occasional sweating does no harm, but persistent condensation will continually wet the floor and allow rot to begin. It also weakens the glue under the tile and causes plywood to delaminate. Surprisingly, the best solutions aren’t all that simple:
<ol>
 	<li>You can reduce the humidity level in your house with a dehumidifier or air conditioner, but that’s expensive if your only goal is to stop toilet condensation.</li>
 	<li>You can glue a thin foam liner to the inside of your tank to insulate it. It works well and costs only about $25, but it can be difficult to install. You have to remove the tank mechanisms, so you’ll need a wide wrench and perhaps new rubber washers. Also, if you buy a new toilet, you can get one that includes a liner.</li>
 	<li>You can hook a hot-water line to the cold through an adjustable “anti-sweat” valve, letting you warm the tank water during warm, humid weather. The valve costs $40 and requires that you run a hot-water feed line.</li>
 	<li>Insulate your tank with a tank cover. You can find these where you buy linens, matched to your towels or carpet. Launder them often to keep them sanitary.</li>
 	<li>Simply lay a towel under the tank to soak up moisture, if it only occurs a few times a year.</li>
</ol>
The DIYer will probably find the tank liner easier to install than the valve. After the initial work, it requires no maintenance and no additional expenses. To install an anti-sweat valve you have to run a hot-water line from the nearby sink hot-water supply. Then you have to adjust the hot/cold water mix as needed. Of course, you’ll pay a small energy cost to heat the water.

You can find both the tank liner and mixing valve at most plumbing supply stores, or they can order one for you.

		<title>6 Hacks for finding Straight, Square, Plumb, and Level</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Avoid problems by starting properly</h2>
There you stand, frustrated and disappointed, in the middle of your half-finished basement. Your dream family room has turned into a nightmare. Beautiful oak doors stick and bind; that last row of floor tiles tapers from 4 in. on one end down to 1 in. on the other; none of the drywall fits quite right; and now, standing ankle deep in wasted oak trim, you wonder where you went wrong.

Well, chances are, it was at the very start, with lumber that wasn't straight, corners that weren't square, and a floor that wasn't level.
<h2>Is my lumber straight?</h2>
<strong>Selecting high-quality material is the first step toward projects that are straight and true. Sight along the edges to check.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1227" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/straight-square-plumb-level.jpg" alt="" width="722" height="674" />
<h2>Is my cabinet square?</h2>
<strong>Check the diagonal measurements and adjust your work until they are equal. The cabinet will then be square.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1228" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/straight-square-plumb-level-1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="347" />
<h2>Are my walls square?</h2>
<strong>Make marks 3ft. along one wall, 4 ft. along the other; then adjust until the diagonal measurement is 5 ft.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1229" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/straight-square-plumb-level-2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="346" />
<h2>Is my location directly overhead?</h2>
<strong>Use a chalkline box or plumb box to transfer locations (like this chimney pipe) up or down.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1230" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/straight-square-plumb-level-3.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="346" />
<h2>Is my floor level?</h2>
<strong>Use a long, straight board to extend the working length of levels and to span small dips and irregularities.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1231" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/straight-square-plumb-level-4.jpg" alt="" width="501" height="351" />
<h2>Is my pipe at the right slope?</h2>
<strong>Determine the correct 1/4-in. drop per foot by placing 1 in. of blocking under the end of a 4-ft. level.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1232" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/straight-square-plumb-level-5.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="349" />
<h2>Is my wall straight?</h2>
<strong>Stretch a string between blocks at each end of the wall. Measure the gap between the test block and string.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1233" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/straight-square-plumb-level-6.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="358" />
<h2>Benefits</h2>
Starting off straight, square, level, and plumb (vertical) is the most crucial step in assuring that your projects turn out looking great. The little extra time spent up front will pay off handsomely all along the way, with less wasted material, fewer hours spent on the job, and a lot less frustration.

Here are detailed instructions at how to do it.
<h2>Is it straight?</h2>
Wood performs amazing contortions as it dries, so be picky when you buy your lumber. If it's too crooked, nothing built with it, on it or next to it will fit well.
<h3>Check straightness by eye</h3>
The naked eye is as good a tool as any when it comes to judging crooked vs. straight. You can detect a hump, or “crown.” as it is called by carpenters, by sighting along the length of a board (Photo). A slight crown is almost inevitable, but you should reject boards where it is very noticeable.

When building a wall, have all the crowns on the same side, so the finished wall doesn't have a wavy surface. With floor joists, a small crown is actually desirable —just make certain you always position the crown up. A joist with a 1/2-in. upward crown will wind up straight if the center settles 1/2 in. A joist with a 1/2-in. downward crown will wind up with a full 1-in. sag after the same amount of settling.
<h3>Compare to a string line</h3>
A string pulled taut is a good way to check straightness. For instance, to see if a wall is straight, tack two spacer blocks of the same thickness at the ends of the wall and stretch a string between the two (Photo 6). By measuring between the string and wall at intermediate points, you can determine how far to push the wall in or out to straighten it. This is a great way to align fence and deck posts, check for sags in floors, or level the grid for a suspended ceiling.
<h3>Snapping a line</h3>
When you need to mark a long, straight line on a wall, ceiling or floor. use a chalk line (see Photo 3). Secure the hook end: reel out the string and pull it taut; then lift the string straight up and let it go.
<h2>Is it square?</h2>
<h3>Cross measuring</h3>
By comparing diagonal measurements (Photo 1) and adjusting accordingly, a person can square up a wall, cabinet door, window — really. any rectangle or square. The diagonal measurements will be equal when the comers are square.
<h3>Squaring with math</h3>
Whether you’re building a birdhouse or a skyscraper, you can check whether comers are square by using the 3-4-5 rule: A triangle with sides of 3, 4 and 5 will form a 90-degree corner. It doesn’t matter whether the measurements are inches, feet or light-years. or whether it’s multiples like 6, 8, 10, or 30, 40, 50 — the corner will always be exactly 90 degrees. The 3-4-5 technique is especially useful for large structures like walls (Photo 2), the framing of a deck, or fence comers.
<h2>What is the difference between level and plumb?</h2>
<strong>“Level” simply means parallel to the earth's surface; “plumb” means perpendicular to this, or straight up and down.</strong>
<h3>Using a level</h3>
Most levels contain three glass vials: ones at each end indicating plumb and one in the middle indicating level. When the bubble is exactly centered between the two lines on the vial. your work is plumb or level — provided your level is accurate.

To test a level’s accuracy. place it on a flat surface and note where the bubble lies in relationship to the centering lines. Tum the level end for end and check if the bubble maintains exactly the same position. Some metal levels can be adjusted. Vials in wood levels can be removed and reputtied, but it's an art — consult the level manufacturer.

Crowned or bowed lumber will give your level a false reading, so when checking the corner of a wall or a door opening for plumb. take two or three readings along the length of the stud to obtain an average.
<h3>Using a plumb bob</h3>
The plumb bob, a string with a pointed weight on one end, is another way of establishing true vertical.

A level is more convenient to use when truing up walls, but plumb bobs shine when it comes to transferring marks from a higher to a lower point — for example, to center a wood stove directly beneath a chimney or to position ceiling fins or lights.

The only hard part about using a plumb bob is waiting for it to stop spinning and swaying before you can transfer your mark.

Most chalk line boxes, with their tapered bodies and centered string holes. can serve double duty as plumb bobs (Photo 3).

		<title>How to (SAFELY) Saw Firewood with a Chainsaw</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nothing beats a chainsaw for fast, efficient cutting. But knowing the right techniques, wearing the right safety apparel and maintaining the right saw came first. Keep reading for more details and pictures on how to safely use a chain saw.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/chain-saw.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="530" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1242" />

<h2>Five Chainsaw Safety Tips</h2>

<ol>
<li>Start your saw safely by firmly gripping the handle between your knees. Keep your left elbow locked as you pull the starter rope with your right hand.</li>
</ol>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/chain-saw-1.jpg" alt="" width="465" height="358" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1243" />

<ol start="2">
<li>Notch cut on the side at the trunk you want the tree to fall. Help support your saw by bracing your right wrist against your right leg. First make the steep upper cut, then an intersecting cut at 90 degrees. Cut through about 1/3 of the tree‘s diameter — never deeper. Remove the wedge.</li>
</ol>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/chain-saw-2.jpg" alt="" width="380" height="326" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1244" />

<ol start="3">
<li>Make the horizontal felling cut 1 in. above the corner of the wedge cut. Never cut all the way through. Leave the hinge section — it controls the direction of the tall and prevents the tree from spinning unpredictably. When the back of the cut begin: to open, turn aft the saw and move away.</li>
</ol>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/chain-saw-3.jpg" alt="" width="364" height="326" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1245" />

<ol start="4">
<li>Undercut a trunk that’s held off the ground at both ends. First make an upper relief cut 1/4 of the way through. Finish by cutting up from below.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
<li>Position yourself to the side, out of the line of kickback. Keep the left elbow locked and the let fingers in an encircling grip. Wear all recommended safety equipment.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Chain saw risks<h2>

A chain saw is "king of the jungle" when it comes to cutting firewood, clearing a path or trimming landscaping timbers to length. But not everyone treats this roaring beast with due respect. Every year there are around 30,000 chain saw accidents. (<a href="http://www.bchw.org/Tech%20tips/SawCertification/Chain%20Saw%20Injuries.htm">Click here if you want to see some really nasty pictures</a>.) <a href="https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/AccidentSearch.search?acc_keyword="Tree%20Trimming"&keyword_list=on">Some 300 people die every year, too</a>.

Surprisingly, many of these injuries will involve not beginners, but experienced users — those who become too comfortable with their saw, then develop bad habits.

The most common injuries, those to the left thigh and hand, could be virtually eliminated if users showed common sense — remembering to grip the saw correctly and keep the bar and chain pointed away from themselves after making a cut.

The following is a quick refresher for those familiar with the basics of working with a chain saw. I hope these reminders keep you cutting safely and efficiently.

<h2>The proper saw</h2>

Chain saw manufacturers continue to improve the safety features of their saws and chains, especially on saws marketed for the homeowner.

Many safety features have been designed to minimize “kickback” — the sudden backlash caused when the upper tip of the chain saw bar and chain catches a limb or other object and propels the chain saw up and back toward the operation.

Specially designed safety chains greatly reduce kickback accidents. These chains cut only slightly slower than regular chains and cost no more: you’re a fool not to use one. Even if your saw didn‘t originally come with a safety chain, it can almost certainly be fitted with one. Anti-kickback tips that cover the bar nose, specially shaped guide bars and chain brakes (guards designed to stop the chain in the event of a kickback) also minimize accidents

<h2>Personal safety equipment</h2>

When you saw, always wear a hard hat and ear and eye protection. A special helmet with attached ear muffs and a full-face screen or shield (like the one pictured) keeps all your above-the-neck safety gear in one compact, easy-to-find package.

Buy and wear protective gloves — leather ones are adequate, but those made with cut-resistant ballistic nylon are best. Protect your legs with chain saw chaps, too; those with layers of Kevlar padding offer some of the best protection money can buy. You may cringe at the thought of spending $350 to $500 on safety equipment you may wear only a few times a year, but this investment pales in comparison to the $9,500 spent mending the average chain saw injury.

<h2>Proper chainsaw cutting technique</h2>

Approach each tree and cut as if the worst could happen — and then chances are it won’t. Remember:

<ul>
<li>Don't operate a saw when you're tired or alone in an isolated area.</li>
<li>Keep your work area clear of debris and bystanders.</li>
<li>Use the correct grip as shown in Photo 1. Always keep the thumb of your left hand wrapped under the front bar, so your fingers form an encircling grip. That way your hand can't slip off the bar and into the chain. Keep the left elbow locked to fend off kickback.</li>
<li>Always hold the saw off to the right side of your body. so the swing of a kickback will miss you (Photo 5).</li>
<li>Never cut when another log or object on the far side of a log could contact the tip of the bar, causing it to kick back.</li>
<li>Be especially careful around metal fences and posts; they can cause kickback, too.</li>
<li>Never cut with the saw above shoulder height or with just one hand.</li>
<li>Give your saw a thorough checkup prior to each use. Check and adjust the tension of the chain: it should move freely around the bar. but not sag.</li>
<li>Make sure you’re using the correct gas/oil mix. Check and replenish your bar oil chamber every time you refuel. Use only specially formulated bar oil — it contains additives that help it cling to the chain and stand up to pressure</li>
<li>Don't attempt tasks beyond your skill range. If you are uncomfortable with a situation, call a pro.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Letting the chips fly</h2>

Transforming a standing tree into firewood involves three basic steps: felling, limbing, and bucking.

Don't even pull the starter rope until you’ve carefully examined the tree you'll be felling and the surrounding area. Take into account wind direction, the lean of the tree, any heavy branches and the landing zone. Check for overhead obstructions and power lines. When you’re comfortable the tree will fall where you intend, make certain you have a clear escape path. A 45-deg'ree angle back and away from the line of the fall is safest. Photos 2 and 3 show the basic felling principles.

Trim off (“limb”) the small branches from the fallen tree before cutting the main branches and trunk into manageable lengths. Start limbing at the top of the tree and stand to the uphill side so cutoffs and branches tall and roll away from you.

Put your saw down and clear your path occasionally; many accidents occur when users are holding the saw in one hand and wrestling branches with the other.

In the course of “bucking” (cutting a tree into firewood lengths) you will encounter branches or tree trunks supported on both ends. You need to make both undercuts and overcuts to reduce the tension, so the wood won't bind and entrap your saw bar. Often you will finish your cut from the underside to avoid binding (Photo 4).

Avoid dipping your chain saw into the ground Dirt and rocks will dull a chain in a fraction of a second.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On a fall evening, as I sit listening to a cold rain pounding on the roof overhead, I always feel grateful for two things:
<ol>
 	<li>that I'm not out there getting soaked, and</li>
 	<li>that my roof doesn‘t leak.</li>
</ol>
Though the wind-driven rain falls in torrents, my roof faithfully blocks the storm and channels the water to valleys and gutters, which carry it away.

Of course, a roof has to do a lot more. It has to endure hot summer temperatures that can build up to 180 degrees F. That’s hot enough to grill a burger! (Or your feet if you‘re trying to do roof work.) At the opposite extreme, it resists bitter cold and ice. It stands ready to shoulder tons of snow for weeks on end. And it has to shrug off powerful winds, sometimes up to hurricane force. And as if mere survival isn't enough, we expect it to continue to perform almost maintenance-free for decades.

Roofs work in quieter, more subtle ways. too. Frequently they open up enough attic space for that extra room. Where roofs overhang exterior walls, they become built-in awnings that protect siding and windows from the corrosive effects of sun and rain. The angles on many roofs create a natural draft to help ventilate attics. cooling them during summer and flushing out unwanted moisture in winter. And, of course, a roof makes a home look good. It’s an architectural crown whose geometry shapes a home's character.

When you add up all those expectations, you’d think there would be one ideal roof type. But not so. The next time you take an evening walk. Take a look at the roofs in your neighborhood and notice the different sizes and shapes that do the job. Here are the types you're likely to see and a few notes on how and why they work so well.
<h2>Gable Roofs</h2>
<strong>The GABLE ROOF on this colonial-style home supports three symmetrical dormers, each with a gable roof. Gable framing uses simple but strong triangular geometry.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1250" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/roof-styles-1-gable.jpg" alt="" width="885" height="906" />

As you stroll through your neighborhood, you’ll probably see gable roofs everywhere, since they're the most common roof shape throughout the USA and Canada. A gable roof looks like a piece of cardboard folded neatly down the middle and laid over the home's walls (Fig. A). The actual gable is the triangular shape of the wall at either end. When you see that shape, you know you’re looking at a gable roof.

They're the easiest and least expensive to construct. Carpenters use three straight pieces of lumber to form the sides of the triangle — two for rafters and one for a ceiling joist. With the corners securely fastened, this triangular geometry creates a strong, stiff structure that can withstand snow loads, people walking on it, and high winds without collapsing.

Though simple, a gable roof that's designed by an imaginative architect or builder won‘t look dull or boring. You might find a dozen of them on your street, and not one identical to another. The variety comes from skillfully arranged combinations of gables, roof slopes, and trim styles. Though many gable roots look complicated, an experienced builder can layout and frame them relatively easily because of the basic shape of the triangle doesn’t change.

Aside from aesthetics, gables have several practical implications for homeowners thinking about remodeling. First. the steepness of a gable’s slope determines how much attic space you have. Steeper slopes mean more attic headroom. Often you can easily convert these attics into living space. You can put windows in the gable walls and add dormers to the roof if you need more headroom (Fig. A). A shallower slope means less headroom and often only enough space for storage, or perhaps no useable space at all.

Second. gables imply a certain kind of wall framing. The two walls that the roof overlaps support the weight of the roof. These walls are called “bearing walls.” You have to allow for that extra weight by installing a strong beam over any new window and door openings you put into those walls.

0n the other hand. the gable walls, the walls that have the telltale triangles in them, usually aren’t bearing. so you don’t need those extra beams over new openings. (However. sometimes gable walls support the second floor of a two-story home and are therefore bearing below the second floor. When remodeling, always check with your building inspector to make sure!)

Gable roofs have another feature that makes them particularly valuable in colder regions. They are excellent ventilators. In particular, gable roofs with lower slopes resemble and work much like the top of an airplane wing. Wind passing over creates a low-pressure zone that exerts a lift on the roof. That lift sucks the air out of vents near the top of the roof, ventilating the attic better, keeping it cooler and removing excess moisture. In winter this venting helps keep the roof colder, so snow on it won’t melt, run down to the root edge, refreeze. and cause those troublesome ice dams that cause leaks.

But in coastal regions, there's such a thing as too much lift, as hurricane Hugo so clearly demonstrated in 1989. Hugo ripped off more low-sloped gable roofs than other types of roof in South Carolina (though other low-sloped styles didn‘t fare so well either). And if the roof didn‘t go, the gable section of wall often blew off due to the pressure created by the roof. While few of our homes will face wind this extreme, the event illustrates that roof shapes perform differently. The roof design that best withstood hurricane Hugo was the hip roof, because. as we shall see, this shape eliminates those gable ends.
<h2>Hip Roofs</h2>
<strong>The hip roof on this American foursquare home reduces the bulk and prominence of the roof. The architect or builder was consistent, pulling hip roofs on the dormer, bay, and porch.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1251" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/roof-styles-2-hip.jpg" alt="" width="713" height="628" />

Hip roofs look like gable roots with the ends clipped off at an angle (Fig. B). That lowers the profile and makes the roof less visually prominent, especially with steeply sloped roofs. A hip roof also reduces the height of the attic, so you’re likely to bump your head on low, angled ceilings if you want to convert it to living space. You’ll probably have to add dormers to increase the headroom.

The hip roof framing is slightly more complicated than a gable roof, and a bit more expensive to build. It still relies on the triangular structure for strength, but the balance of forces that work through those hip rafters and “jacks” (Fig. B) is less obvious.

The style is a good one, though, so don‘t shy away from building a hip roof if you get a chance. They're easier to assemble than they look. Notice that the hip rafter intersects the corner at a 45-degree angle to each wall. and the jacks meet the hip rafter at 45 degrees, too. So all the rafters are easy to cut. For rafter lengths, turn to a basic framing book. like <a rel="nofollow">"Modern Carpentry" by Willis Wagner. Or your framing square might have the lengths stamped right into its metal blade for each common roof slope.</a>

A hip roof has other implications for remodelers, too. Rafters lap over every wall, spreading the roof weight more evenly but making each wall a bearing one. So if you remodel the walls below a hip roof, you'll need to add a beam over each new window and door opening to support the weight.

Hip roofs are the rule in some neighborhoods, especially those built during the 1950s and 1960s when they were commonly featured on long, low. ranch-style homes. But you’ll also see them on both newer and older homes as well. The style is practical as well as aesthetically pleasing when used with wide overhangs Since the roof overhangs all sides of the house, it protects the walls and windows from sunlight and rain better than gable roofs do.
<h2>FlatRoofss</h2>
<strong>Flat and shed roofs are common in contemporary design and in solar homes, where large, south-facing walls catch maximum sunlight.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1252" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/roof-styles-3-flat.jpg" alt="" width="494" height="268" />

Numerous leaks through the roof of my boyhood treehouse taught me to be wary of flat roofs of course, neither my roofing skills nor the material on that project were very good. It turns out that laying a leak-proof flat roof requires professional expertise anyway.

Flat roofs don't shed water like sloped roofs (though they drain water), so they consist of a watertight membrane rather than lapped shingles. The old method in which hot tar was mapped between and over three layers of asphalt-impregnated felt worked fairly well, but it’s giving way to single-layer synthetic coverings, In any case, repair of these roofs is better left to qualified pros.

While they never became very popular for homes, flat roofs are standard on commercial buildings. They make sense to minimize a big building’s profile, especially one that would require a huge sloped roof, They also cut costs by eliminating rafters; builders simply beef up the ceiling joists to carry the roof weight.
<h2>Shed Roofs</h2>
A shed roof is really half of a gable roof with the upper and lower sides supported by bearing walls. It’s one of the simplest structures for protection from the elements, so it‘s often an economical, quick solution for an addition or porch roof. You have to build only one bearing wall, since you can use the house wall to support the other side. You’ll see many of them used for dormers, too.

Shed roofs, along with flat roots, are a defining feature of so-called “contemporary” design (Flg. C). Most of these homes were built in the second half of the 20th century. Often you see shed rook in solar designs, where the wall supporting the high end of the roof faces south, so the windows in that wall can catch more sunlight.

Still, flat and shed roof haven’t become very popular. Gable and hip roofs almost completely dominate residential construction these days. Two other types, once common in pre-1950 homes, have virtually disappeared, though they continue to dot many older neighborhoods in most cities — the mansard and gambrel.
<h2>Mansards</h2>
<strong>Homes with mansard roofs are increasingly rare, though the style often appears on commercial buildings.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1253" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/roof-styles-4-mansard.jpg" alt="" width="494" height="295" />

In the 17th century, a French architect named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/François_Mansart"> Francois Mansart</a> invented the roof that bears his name. Indeed, the design still reminds many of its French roots, perhaps because it looks so unusual and foreign.

The mansard roof has two pitches, a shallow top and steep side, and the roof overlaps and bears on all the side walls (Fig. D). It’s a big-volume roof containing maximum attic space, which is usually used as a second floor. In fact, when some homeowners remodel old homes and convert them to apartment rental units. they remove the gable roof and put on a mansard to get more space.

While practical. mansards virtually disappeared in home construction after the 1940s. However. you might notice remnants of the style in the steeply roofed facades of fast-food restaurants and other small commercial buildings.

<strong>Both roof types create easily used living space. The roof framing also frames the walls and railing of the attic room.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1254" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/roof-styles-5-gambrel.jpg" alt="" width="349" height="246" />
<h2>Gambrels</h2>
<strong>The double-gambrel roof on this home creates maximum attic space, virtually an entire second floor.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1255" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/roof-styles-6-double-gambrel.jpg" alt="" width="422" height="304" />

A gambrel roof is easy to recognize. It will immediately remind you of a barn (Fig. F). Though the style emerged in the USA, during the colonial period, no one knows who invented it or why. Perhaps its popularity as a barn structure gives us a clue; it offers more interior volume. The wider root enlarges the attic and makes it a natural living space.

It has an advantage from a framing standpoint, too. You don‘t need such long and perhaps hard-to-find rafters. You can substitute two lighter, more easily handled, short rafters instead.

Gambrels are efficient, compact houses. They incorporate the maximum amount of useable living space in the smallest, least prominent exterior shell by literally cramming more under the roof. Notice in Fig, E that the roof framing also frames the walls and ceiling for finishing off the interior. Home builders typically punctured the lower roof plane with dormers and windows to better light and ventilate what essentially becomes a second floor, rather than an attic.

Gambrel roofs are a bit more complicated to assemble and their attics more difficult to ventilate than gable roofs. While that makes them slightly more expensive, I suspect the design has fallen victim to a greater homogenization of our current building styles. More spacious suburban lots and bigger homes make their compactness, the main advantage of a gambrel, unnecessary. In browsing through several current books oi house plans, I couldn’t find a single gambrel roof. So unless interest in gambrels revives, this style will soon die out.
<h2>Two Final Notes</h2>
While we deal with each roof style separately in both our text and illustrations, you'll often see several types on the same home. Architects and builders commonly combine them. So you'll find gable and shed dormers on hip roofs, hip-roofed porches on gabled homes, and shed roofs attached just about anywhere.

But <strong>roofs have become plainer in the last 30 years</strong>. That’s because many builders now use trusses for the roof structure. Trusses rely on a system of smaller-width rafters and ceiling joists reinforced by a web of crosspieces. They’re factory-built and erected at the home site.

Unfortunately, the cross-pieces render the attic space unuseable, except perhaps for lightweight storage, because you can’t cut and remove them to open up attic space without weakening the entire roof structure. The result is plainer, less interesting roofs on newer homes because, without attic living space, dormers and windows in the roof serve no purpose.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Maybe it's my imagination, but lately my Craftsman <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-drill-driver-kit/">cordless drill</a> seems a bit sluggish. It’s seen a lot of use, so I think it’s time to give it a cleaning and replace the brushes.

But how to proceed?

The first step is to remove the battery pack, housing screws and housing.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/replacing-drill-brushes-1.jpg" alt="" width="352" height="386" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1263" />

Use a clean paint brush to sweep dirt from parts. Be careful not to damage fragile wires. (A good cleaning tool for removing dirt from inaccessible spots is compressed air-in-a-can. It's the stuff photographers use for blowing dust off optical parts and is available at photo supply stores. Use short spurts of air for more effective cleaning.)

Before you begin to replace the brushes, familiarize yourself with the layout of the brush assemblies.

Remove the brush wires from the switch. They can be pulled out of the slots easily.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/replacing-drill-brushes-2.jpg" alt="" width="409" height="292" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1264" />

Next, remove the motor housing screws and motor housing. This will reveal the brush holders, which are located on both sides of the drill arbor.

Slide the brush holder out.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/replacing-drill-brushes-3.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="250" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1265" />

Carefully loosen the brush hold-down spring. (Wear protective eyewear, just in case the spring pops loose.) Move the hold-down spring out of the way.

Slide the brush out of the brush holder. The brush and brush wire are one piece.

Insert new brush into brush holder. Make sure the new brush has the brush wire attached. Follow this procedure for the other worn brush. Then, connect brush wires to switch and assemble.

		<title>How to Remove Paint Splatter from Eyeglasses</title>
		<link>http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/remove-paint-from-eyeglasses/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It happened to me once. I got paint spatters on my <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/eye-protection/">pair of glasses with a scratch-resistant finish</a>, and I didn‘t want to clean them in a way that would ruin that finish. Then I had to search online for the best way to remove paint spatter from my eyeglasses.

<strong>The truth is simple: the scratch-resistant coating on your lenses doesn’t make a bit of difference in the way you should clean them. Clean your glasses with acetone and a salt cotton cloth, following all label precautions. If you don’t have any acetone handy, fingernail polish remover will work just fine. Never clean your lenses by rubbing them with a dry cloth, and never use paint removers or abrasive cleaners.</strong>

There is one exception, however. If you have polycarbonate lenses, which are thinner and lighter than regular plastic lenses, use rubbing alcohol instead of acetone (and be patient).

Ask an optometrist if you’re uncertain what your lenses are made of.

		<title>Leaky Roofs: Common Causes (and their Solutions)</title>
		<link>http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/leaky-roofs-causes-and-solutions/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Three feet of water fall on the average house in an average year— that's 75 tons or 518,400,000 raindrops by my estimate. The shingles and flashings of your roof must work together, day in and day out, to prevent that cascade of water from working its way inside. At the same time, your roof must let chimneys and vents escape through it, endure loo-degree temperature fluctuations and serve as an attractive part of your home’s exterior.

That’s what I call an awesome task!

Your roof needs all the help it can get — and you can help it out with simple repairs and maintenance.

Fixing a leaky roof is a job that simply can't be put off; seeping water can damage not only the plaster and paint on the walls. But the structural framework and insulation within as well.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1271" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/leaky-roof.jpg" alt="" width="735" height="1005" />

You may be hesitant to tackle roof repairs — and indeed the heights and slopes of your roof should be approached with great caution. Yet with the proper know-how and a few simple tools and materials. you can perform many simple repairs to your asphalt or fiberglass shingles, vents, and flashings.

Here’s how.
<h2>Where’s my water coming from?</h2>
<h3>Plumbing pipe flashings and metal chimneys</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1272" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/leaky-roof-1-plumbing-pipe-flashing-921x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="619" />

All vent and chimney bases (and there are plenty of them on your roof) shed water the same way. The bottom half of the chimney or vent flashing lies on top of the shingles, while the upper half is covered by them.

<strong>Running a bead of caulk where a shingle overlaps onto a flashing (or vice versa) can stop some leaks - especially wind-driven ones.</strong>

Occasionally, hail, branches, or corrosion will create a small hole in the vent or base. These can be fixed in the same manner as a hole in valley flashing. Severely damaged vents should be replaced.
<h4>Leaking plumbing stack</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Peel back the shingles that overlap onto the upper half of the vent flashing, then remove the old vent.</li>
 	<li>Install neoprene boot flashing and reinstall shingles.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Leak at top of storm collar</h4>
Run silicone caulk where the collar meets the chimney stack.
<h3>Masonry chimneys and flashings</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1273" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/leaky-roof-2-masonry-chimney-961x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="594" />

Areas where brick and mortar meet shingles are a common source of leaks. A house and chimney often settle and move at different rates, causing flashings to pull away from the shingles or mortar joints.

<strong>If the repairs described don't stop the leak, lift the shingles and run roofing tar where they abut chimney and flashing.</strong>

Pay immediate attention to a cracked chimney cap. Cracks allow water to seep inside the chimney where it can freeze, expand, and destroy the entire structure.
<h4>Cement chimney cap is cracked</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Brush off loose cement and dirt.</li>
 	<li>Force butyl caulk into the cracks, then smooth.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Counterflashing has pulled out from between the bricks</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Scrape out all the old loose mortar using first a chisel, then a wire brush.</li>
 	<li>Push flashing back in place, then fill the mortar joint with butyl caulk. Also, seal the joint where counterflashing overlaps the step flashing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Valley flashing repairs</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1274" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/leaky-roof-3-vally-flashing-976x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="584" />

Valleys can be composed of either metal or thick roll roofing - a thick, solid shingle-like material that comes in 36-in. wide rolls.

<strong>Repairs to roll roofing and metal valleys are similar, with a few notable exceptions. Use roofing tar to plug small holes in roll roofing (the tar can be camouflaged by rubbing two pieces of roll roofing or shingles together and sprinkling the granules into the wet cement). Also use a section of shingle, rather than a metal patch, for repairs to roll roofing valleys.</strong>

Holes and cracks into either type can be temporarily patched, but severely damaged flashing is a signal that soon you'll be needing a new roof.
<h4>Larger holes or rips in metal valleys</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Apply a layer of roofing cement around the hole.</li>
 	<li>Cut an oversized patch and embed it in the cement; cover the area with a second coat of roofing cement.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Small holes in metal valleys</h4>
Fill them with butyl caulk, then smooth with a wet finger. (Paint them silver is appearance is a consideration.)
<h4>Leak between shingles and valley</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Caulk with roofing cement where the shingles lap onto the flashing.</li>
 	<li>Start at the bottom of the flashing, lap each shingle and run a bead of roofing cement onto the flashing and along the entire length of the shingle below; then press the upper shingle into the caulk.</li>
 	<li>Move up to the next shingle and repeat.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Missing shingle</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1275" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/leaky-roof-4-shingles-1024x842.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="458" />

<strong>This is the most common roofing malady. One missing shingle can start a chain reaction by which surrounding shingles become susceptible to wind and weather and, in turn, blow off.</strong>
<h4>Repairing a missing or damaged shingle</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Use a pry bar to remove the nails securing the damaged shingle and the shingle above.</li>
 	<li>Slip a new shingle into place. Secure tabs with roofing cement.</li>
 	<li>Secure the new shingle in place with galvanized roofing nails.</li>
</ul>
<h2>More details on roof leaks</h2>
The wide open planes of a roof don't leak – unless shingles are missing entirely. The problems occur where shingles are interrupted by skylights and chimneys or by vents that exhaust air from bathroom fans, plumbing pipes or attic areas.

Valleys (the diagonal troughs formed where two roofs meet) are another common trouble spot.

Leaks can be baffling to trace. Water may enter a cracked roof vent, sneak across the plywood sheathing, slip in at a seam and follow a sloped roof rafter, then creep along the drywall and dribble from a ceiling light fixture 10 ft. or more from the original point of entry.

Begin your leak investigation with a trip to the attic during a rain shower (or while an accomplice sprays water on the roof with a garden hose). You may have to pull insulation away and contend with dust, mold and general gross stuff, so wear gloves, a dust mask and long pants and shirt. Equip yourself with a flashlight or extension light, too. Mark the leaks you find with chalk, then note where they are in reference to a chimney or end wall so you can locate them when you go up on the roof.

When the roof is dry, climb up to it after safely positioning your extension ladder. Investigate the leaking section and the area above. If you’re lucky. you’ll find something obvious — a missing shingle, protruding nails, your kid’s Tarzan spear. Otherwise, look carefully for the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Shingles, vents, and valleys that have been loosened or torn by wind, ice, hail or tree limbs.</li>
 	<li>Missing, curled or cracked shingles</li>
 	<li>Missing or dried-out caulk — especially around masonry chimneys and skylights</li>
 	<li>Metal flashings (which direct water away from chimneys and other areas) that have pulled away from the shingles or chimney</li>
 	<li>Sagging sections of roof, indicating rotted roof boards, plywood or rafters (get off the roof pronto, and call a pro).</li>
</ul>
If your leak occurs only during a rainstorm accompanied by strong winds, you need to look in less obvious places. Wind could be forcing the water up and under shingles, up and into vents, or sideways between your shingles and roof sheathing at the eaves. Your best chance of tracing this leak is to watch from inside your attic as someone simulates a storm with a hose spraying hard at a horizontal angle.
<h2>When should you call a pro?</h2>
Everyone has his own comfort zone when it comes to heights; some people just have more mountain goat genes in them than others. If you tremble at the mere thought of an extension ladder, use this article as a guide in helping you discuss your repairs with a pro. Consider these other limitations:
<ul>
 	<li>Avoid steep roofs (over 30 degrees) and houses over two stories high. They’re dangerous to work and walk on.</li>
 	<li>Don’t tackle repairs that require tearing off shingles and replacing underlying plywood, sheathing or rafters. A professional contractor will enlist a swarm of workers to do the demolition and repairs in one or two days. A DIYer could spend weeks — and if a storm hits in mid-repair you’ll have the ultimate leak.</li>
 	<li>Avoid odd-looking roof lines and flashings. Houses that have been added onto and remodeled may have flat sections of roof or areas where several roof lines converge These areas require specially made flashings — something a sheet metal shop should fabricate and a pro should install.</li>
 	<li>To protect an area where a vertical wall meets a roof, “step flashing” (a series of L-shaped pieces of metal that lie under the shingles and siding) offers the best protection. Repairing these areas can involve removing both the siding (or stucco) and shingles. Step flashing is rarely damaged — if you have a leak in an area where a wall meets the roof, chances are it was flashed incorrectly or not at all when the home was first built. If you do find a cracked or missing piece of siding material, repairing it may cure the leak.</li>
 	<li>Ice damming — the tendency of melted snow to accumulate and freeze at the eave area, then back up under shingles. remelt and enter the home — is a problem in cold climates. A permanent cure requires surgery by a pro.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Repair or replace?</h2>
An asphalt or fiberglass shingle roof normally lasts 15 to 25 years At some point you need to stop patching and think about reshingling the entire roof.

To check the overall condition:
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li>Pinch off a corner from a shingle; if the inside appears black it still has protective oils. If the inside is gray or crumbly, it’s time to replace.</li>
 	<li>Bend back a few corners: the shingles should be flexible and resilient on a 70-degree day If they seem brittle and crack, they can easily be torn off in the wind, and it‘s time to replace.</li>
 	<li>Look for areas where shingles are discolored or streaked. This indicates the granular top coat is deteriorating and chances are the shingles are ready for replacement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Roof maintenance</h2>
Perform a yearly inspection These steps will prolong the life of your roof:
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li>Resecure any loose or curled shingles with a line of roofing cement along the bottom edge of each tab. Dab exposed nailheads with roofing cement. Tool</li>
 	<li>Clear off any debris. especially from valleys where it can impede the flow of water.</li>
 	<li>Cut back branches within reach of your house so that even in a strong wind they won’t batter your roof and damage shingles.</li>
 	<li>Clean out your gutters. Overflowing water can damage your eaves, and in severe cases, work its way into your home.</li>
 	<li>If cable TV has made your roof antenna obsolete, remove it — it can only cause damage Antennas attached to chimneys are a major cause of chimney damage: they act as big pry bars that blow in the wind and loose bricks and mortar. If your antenna was roof-mounted, dab the holes where the hook eyes or anchors used to be with roofing cement.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tools, materials, and safety</h2>
A good caulking gun will be your best friend for most roofing repairs A pry bar, hammer, and tin snips may be needed at times. and a sturdy extension ladder is mandatory Keep yourself, your ladder, and your tools far away from all electrical wires that enter your home or pass overhead.

Various caulks excel at various tasks — use the ones recommended:
<ul>
 	<li>Roofing cement, also called plastic roof cement, is the best caulk for shingle-to-shingle or shingle-to-metal repairs.</li>
 	<li>“Wet surface” cement can be applied to both wet and dry surfaces.</li>
 	<li>Butyl caulks excel at adhering to metals such as valleys or gutters, even when totally submerged in water.</li>
 	<li>Silicone adheres well to metals and remains flexible over a wide temperature range.</li>
 	<li>Asphalt-coated fabric (available in 5-in. wide rolls at well-stocked hardware stores) is a screen-like mesh that can be embedded in and covered with, roofing cement for patching cracks that extend through several rows of shingles. This should be considered a temporary fix and a pretty unsightly one at that. Patch damaged areas with shingles when possible.</li>
</ul>
Wear loose, comfortable clothing and sneakers or soft rubber-soled shoes when on the roof. Avoid working in extreme temperatures. In hot weather the shingles are gummy and can tear; in cold weather the shingles are brittle.

Finally, never work alone. Your assistant can help secure the bottom of the ladder, fetch tools and materials, and help out in an emergency.</li>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you’ve ever wandered through a garage sale, you've probably found a piece of furniture that you fell in love with — at first glance. But upon closer inspection, its outward appearance looked like it was beyond hope.

Well, now you can buy those ugly ducklings. because you will learn how to remove that old, worn-out finish and bring back the natural beauty of the wood. Even if you’ve never stripped furniture before.
<ol>
 	<li>Apply stripper with an old paint brush. Spread it in one direction only, because back-and-forth strokes reduce the stripper’s potency.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1292" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strip-furniture-1-1024x590.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="321" />
<ol start="2">
 	<li>Remove the stripper from flat surfaces with a putty knite. Don’t tone the stripper if it doesn’t come up easily. You may need to apply another coat and try again. Use a vegetable brush to loosen finish on rounded areas (inset photo) .</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1293" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strip-furniture-2.jpg" alt="" width="944" height="634" />
<ol start="3">
 	<li>Loosen the stripper and old finish along edges and corners with a brass-bristle brush. It’ll work better than a toothbrush and it won’t damage the wood.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1294" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strip-furniture-3.jpg" alt="" width="667" height="478" />
<ol start="4">
 	<li>Clean out stripper and old finish along edges and grooves with a scratch owl. Use light, soft strokes to avoid damaging the wood. To remove finish around carved or raised areas, use medium-grade steel wool wrapped around string. Move the string in a shoeshine motion (inset photo).</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1295" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strip-furniture-4.jpg" alt="" width="775" height="447" />
<ol start="5">
 	<li>Wash the entire surface to remove any residue. Use mineral spirits to wash solvent-base strippers, clear water for water-base strippers.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1296" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strip-furniture-5.jpg" alt="" width="413" height="538" />
<ol start="6">
 	<li>Bleach out black water stains with an oxalic acid solution — it may take two applications. Neutralize the acid with a borax and water solution.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1297" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strip-furniture-6.jpg" alt="" width="724" height="520" />
<ol start="7">
 	<li>Sand the surfaces beginning with 100-grit sandpaper, then 180-grit and finally 220-grit paper.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1298" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strip-furniture-7.jpg" alt="" width="457" height="410" />
<ol start="8">
 	<li>Wipe the entire surface with a tack cloth. The tack cloth’s sticky coating picks up and holds any dust, which ensures a good-looking finish.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1299" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strip-furniture-8.jpg" alt="" width="349" height="371" />
<ol start="9">
 	<li>Apply the new stain following the manufacturer’s instructions. Finally, apply the top coat. Use the same brand stain and top coat for best results.</li>
 	<li>By following these 10 steps, you too can bring back the natural beauty of the wood.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Do you have to strip?</h2>
Completely removing the finish from an old piece of furniture, or "stripping," may not be necessary. Often. the old finish is just tired or dirty and only needs a good cleaning, or what's called “restoration.”

That’s a thorough scrubbing of the wood with mineral spirits, followed by a couple of new coats of varnish.

But if the old finish, whether it's paint or varnish, is cracked or flaking, it’s time to strip. If you want to change the color, it's time to strip. Or if you want to put on a hard-finish topcoat, such as polyurethane, the only way to get good results is to first strip off the old finish. And, finally, if the piece has deep stains or scratches, stripping is the first step in repairing these problems.
<h2>Tools needed</h2>
Here are the tools you'll need to remove old finishes, all of which are in your home now or available at most paint and hardware stores:
<ul>
 	<li>two flexible putty knives — one with a 2-in. wide blade and one with a 3- or 4-in. wide blade.</li>
 	<li>medium-grade steel wool, or a finish-stripping scrub pad.</li>
 	<li>a brass-bristle brush.</li>
 	<li>a scratch awl or ice pick.</li>
 	<li>a kitchen vegetable brush.</li>
 	<li>string.</li>
 	<li>old toothbrushes.</li>
 	<li>old 1-1/2 or 2-in. wide paint brushes to apply the paint stripper.</li>
 	<li>cardboard, newspapers or an old dropcloth that you're willing to throw away.</li>
 	<li>aluminum pie tins — to catch the drips and to collect the old finish.</li>
 	<li>rags.</li>
 	<li>mineral spirits — for solvent-base stripper cleanup.</li>
 	<li>oxalic acid and borax — to remove black water stains.</li>
 	<li>tack cloth, and.</li>
 	<li>safety gear (more details below).</li>
</ul>
You'll notice that a number of these tools should be “old.” Stripping is a messy job and often the tools need to be thrown away after use.

Also, buy only the smallest amount of stripper that you think you'll need to do the job. Storing excess stripper in your home can be dangerous. It’s better to have to buy more than to store.
<h2>Choosing a paint stripper</h2>
Deciding which stripper to use will depend on a number of factors: your safety when using the stripper, what you’ll be stripping, how much time you have to do the job, and how much money you want to spend.

Most solvent-base strippers contain methylene chloride, a potent chemical that makes them fast and thorough. However. the vapors these products give off as they evaporate can be extremely dangerous, even deadly.

If you or a member of your family is sensitive to chemical fumes, is pregnant or you simply want to play it safe, consider using a water-base stripper. These products are safe to use in most situations, according to the manufacturers.

Since stripping furniture involves both horizontal and vertical surfaces, it's best to choose a stripper with a semi-paste consistency The semi-paste type will cling to the vertical surfaces; liquid strippers won't.

You also need to decide how much time you have to work on the project. If you want the stripper to work in minutes, use a solvent-base stripper. But if you can let strippers work for hours or even overnight, consider using the water-base type.

The cost of materials could also be a factor. Water-base strippers cost 40% more than solvent-base strippers.

Finally, you could consider having the furniture stripped by a professional.
<h2>Safety equipment</h2>
Here‘s a good point to remember: If a product is strong enough to strip paint, you don‘t want to breathe it into your lungs, get it on your skin or in your eyes. To prevent this, you need to use the following safety equipment:
<ul>
 	<li>Safety goggles. Make sure you get goggles and not glasses. Goggles wrap around the head and protect the entire eye; glasses don‘t.</li>
 	<li>Solvent-resistant gloves. Don’t use the rubber type you wear when you wash dishes.</li>
 	<li>A <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/respirators/">respirator</a>. Make sure it’s a certified respirator, suitable for use with paint strippers.</li>
</ul>
These products are available at most full-service paint stores.

Also, wear a long-sleeve shirt to keep the stripper off your arms.
<h2>Stripping timetable</h2>
Stripping furniture is not a quick, one-day project. It’ll take a minimum of two days, depending on how difficult it is to remove the old finish, the size of the piece and whether there are ornate carvings and moldings.

Flat surfaces strip the fastest; intricate carvings and curved or rounded pieces often require multiple applications of stripper.

The most important point on using paint stripper: Don’t rush it. Read the container label before starting and then follow the instructions completely.

Once you apply the stripper, give it time to penetrate, but don’t let it dry out. If it does, you‘re in for even more work.
<h2>Ten steps to success</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Your work area must be well ventilated. If possible. work outdoors in a shaded area, such as on a patio or at the apron area of your garage. The temperature should be above 50 degrees F.</li>
 	<li>Once you choose a spot. lay down cardboard or three or four layers of newspaper.</li>
 	<li>Make sure you’ve read the directions on the stripper container.</li>
 	<li>Apply the recommended amount of shipper using an old paint brush (Photo 1). Spread the stripper in one direction only. A back-and-forth brushing action will reduce its potency.</li>
 	<li>Let the stripper work the recommended length of time. For solvent-base strippers it's between 10 and 30 minutes. Water-base strippers need to work longer, at least a couple of hours or even overnight.</li>
 	<li>If you’re using a solvent-base stripper, check it periodically to make sure it doesn't dry out. If it starts to dry, apply a little more, in the same direction as the first coat.</li>
 	<li>When the stripper has been in place the recommended time, lightly rub the area with medium-grade steel wool or a paint-stripping scrub pad to loosen the old finish.</li>
 	<li>Now use a putty knife to remove the old finish from the flat surfaces (Photo 2). A vegetable brush works great on
curved areas, such as legs (inset Photo 2). Use the aluminum pie tins to collect the old finish.</li>
 	<li>This table had a raised edge, grooves and round sections — three areas that are always hard to strip. Here’s how each was dealt with:
<ul>
 	<li>A brass-bristle brush was used to loosen the old finish along the raised edge (Photo 3) .</li>
 	<li>A scratch awl was used to remove old finish from the edges (Photo 4). Make light strokes to avoid gouging the wood.</li>
 	<li>And, to remove the finish from the round legs, I wrapped medium-grade steel wool around a length of string and used it in a back-and-forth, shoeshine motion (inset, Photo 4). .</li>
</ul>
.</li>
 	<li>Finally, don’t get discouraged if all the finish doesn't come off the first time. Be prepared to apply more coats of stripper, especially in curved or carved areas.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Disposing of the old finish</h2>
Once the piece is completely stripped, you’ll have to dispose of the old finish. The best way to do this is to put the aluminum pie plates outside in the shade and allow the stripper to evaporate. Place any solvent-soaked rags outside, too. Make sure they’re out of the reach of kids and pets.

Most cities have hazardous waste disposal areas that will take this type of residue. Contact your city hall for instructions for your area.
<h2>Once the old stuff is off</h2>
Before you apply the new finish, make sure the surfaces are smooth and clean. To get rid of any solvent stripper residue, rinse the entire surface with mineral spirits (Photo 5). If the stripper is water-base, use clear water.

If you notice any black water stains on the stripped areas, you can bleach them out using an oxalic acid solution (Photo 6). Then neutralize the acid with a borax and water solution. Oxalic acid and borax are available at most full-service paint stores. Follow the directions and safety instructions on the oxalic acid container.

To get the best-looking finish, you need to sand the stripped wood. Sanding is done in three stages: Use 100-grit (medium) sandpaper for the first sanding; 180-grit (fine) for the second; and for the final sanding, use 220-grit (very fine) sandpaper (Photo 7).

To get rid of any dust, wipe the entire piece with a tack cloth (Photo 8). The tack cloth is a cheese cloth that has a
sticky coating to pick up and hold dust.
<h2>The new finish</h2>
Now you're ready to apply the new stain (Photo 9), but make sure the piece is dry first. Any major brand name product should give you good results, if you follow the directions.

Apply a final top coat. If the piece will get heavy-duty use, consider applying polyurethane rather than regular varnish. It's recommended that you apply the same brand stain and finish.

<strong>Wear hearing protection! A circular saw can be as loud and nerve-wracking as a jackhammer. Hearing lost is usually gone forever.</strong>

I hated it! Despised il! Avoided it! <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/can-you-cut-plywood-with-a-jigsaw/">Cutting plywood with a circular saw</a> was a chore l absolutely dreaded. But why? It wasn't the weight, size, smell or cost of the wood that tormented me. So, why?

I finally realized the tormenter was one I couldn't see: it was noise, that piercing howl at a whirling blade grinding through stubborn plywood.

Loud noise causes pain; a pain no less real, no less damaging, than whacking your thumb with a hammer or dropping a brick on your toe. Worse yet, hearing damage is permanent. Add in the evidence that noise causes high blood pressure, ulcers, and headaches — and you‘ve got a great case for wearing hearing protection.

What’s hearing protection gotta do with “Using Tools”? In my book, a tool is anything that helps a job go faster, safer or makes a task more enjoyable. Hearing protection does all three.
<h2>Ear Anatomy 101</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ppe-hearing-protection-2.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="275" />

The intricate workings of the ear — how sound waves are turned into electrical impulses the brain can understand — are a small miracle. The sound is channeled through the ear canal and eardrum, then on to the middle ear (remember the hammer, anvil, and stirrup from seventh-grade biology?) It's in the cochlea of the inner ear that most noise-related hearing damage occurs.

The cochlea is lined with small hairs that move nerve impulses along to the brain. These hairs can be bent, broken or literally blown away by loud noises. The hairs in the first bend of the cochlea — the high-frequency receptors — are the most susceptible to damage. Damage to these means soft sounds like S, SH, and F or higher pitched voices cannot be heard as easily (while deeper voices or stronger sounds may still be understood). These high-frequency receptors are also the first to go with age; many people begin to experience a natural hearing loss at around 50 years of age.

Tinnitus, a constant ringing of the ears, can be caused by long exposure to loud noise, or even by a single enormous impact noise. Woodworkers, musicians and factory workers are often plagued by tinnitus.

Remember, the damaged nerve cells of an ear will never heal. Hold onto what you've got. Use hearing protection.
<h2>Understanding and choosing protection</h2>
Do your ears a favor and take a minute to walk through some simple math.

[table id=24 responsive=collapse /]

Noise is measured in decibels (db): the louder the noise. the higher the db rating. Most experts peg 85 db as the safe maximum noise level. Hearing protection devices are rated in terms of their ability to block noise and lower decibel levels: this is their noise reduction rating (NRR). Hearing protection with an NRR of 30 will reduce the noise reaching your ears by around 30 db.

Tying all this together, if you're working with a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-circular-saw/">circular saw</a> screaming at 110 db, you need a hearing protector rated at 25 NRR or more to bring your ears into the sale range (110 db minus 25 db equals 85 db). Extremely loud situations. such as rifle ranges or jackhammering, dictate using ears muffs and earplugs combined.

Hearing protection comes in two basic types: in-the-ear (Photo 1 and outside-the-ear (Photo 2) varieties. In selecting a protector, pick one with an NRR that brings your hearing into the 85 db safe range. Also, make certain to pick one that’s comfortable and convenient enough so you'll actually wear it.
<h3>In-the-ear protectors</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1307" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ppe-hearing-protection-4.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="519" />

<strong>Foam earplugs</strong> are available in corded and non-corded styles. Inexpensive and difficult to clean, they are considered disposable. <strong>Flange-type earplugs</strong> are washable, reusable, and comfortable. Available corded or non-corded. <strong>Banded earplugs</strong> combine the protection of an in-ear device with the convenience of a hearing muff. Pads swivel for comfort.

They are inexpensive, yet otter extremely good protection. The best in-ear earplugs otter an NRR of 33. Their effectiveness lies in their ability to conform to the ear canal, blocking the sound paths. Foam types are twisted then inserted in the ear, when they expand to block the ear canal.

On the downside, flange (Photo 1) and foam plugs do such a good job blocking noise that they can make normal conversation difficult. And because they go inside the ear where they pick on wax and oils, they're more likely to attract dirt and sawdust when removed. They must be replaced or cleaned frequently. Also, some people simply don’t like putting things inside their ears.
<h3>Outside-the-ear protectors</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1308" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ppe-hearing-protection-5.jpg" alt="" width="597" height="571" />

<strong>Noise-activated earmuffs</strong> may be either battery operated or non-electronic. These muffs increase the amount of protection as noise levels rise, yet permit (or amplify) normal conversation. <strong>Wrap-around earmuffs</strong> with a strap that wraps around neck allow hard hats and helmets to be easily worn. Other versions have muffs that attach directly to headgear. <strong>Foam ear caps</strong> are ideal for those who don’t like using in-ear earplugs or larger muff-style hearing protection. Worn under the chin, they are lightweight and easy to use. <strong>Combination goggle-muffs</strong> combine hearing and sight protection into one easy-to-use unit.

They cost more, but last longer (and are harder to misplace). The best earmuff offers an NRR of around 30. They generally permit conversation more easily than earplugs. When not in use, they can be looped down around the neck or be perched atop the head, Mickey Mouse style. They also protect the tender outer ear from flying debris.

Bear in mind, cotton and tissue paper don't offer adequate protection (though damp tissue paper will work in a pinch). Radio headphones only add to the noise level.
<h2>When to wear hearing protection</h2>
Ideally. you should wear hearing protection any time the noise level exceeds 85 db (the approximate volume of a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-drill-driver-kit/">drill</a> or garbage disposal).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1306" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ppe-hearing-protection-3.jpg" alt="" width="566" height="287" />

Of course. wearing hearing protection isn't always practical, but be especially diligent around:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Power tools</strong>. The high-pitched whine or a router or miter saw can be especially damaging. Even clean up afterward with a wet-dry vacuum can be painfully loud.</li>
 	<li><strong>Impact sounds</strong>. Hammering in a confined space can be torturous, even with a small hammer. The crack and screech of pry bars during demolition can be amazingly noisy, too.</li>
 	<li><strong>Outdoor equipment</strong>. Chainsaws, lawn mowers, and string trimmers all call tor hearing protection even if your neighbors think you look funny. Hard hats with integral face shield and earmuffs are available for chainsawing.</li>
 	<li><strong>Sporting and concert events</strong>. The noise from a gunshot is at the top of the decibel chart. Rock concerts can peak at 130 db.</li>
</ul>
At first, hearing protection may make you feel uncomfortable or out of touch with the sound or your tools. The whim and warning signs of your power tools will sound different but after a while, you'll relearn these sounds.

After trying both types, I've settled on muffs. The same pair has been my companion in the workshop and on the workshop for 10 years. In time, hearing protection becomes habit forming. I would no more cut a board without my muffs than drive my car without a seatbelt.

Use hearing protection even for short work periods. Hearing loss is cumulative; lots of short working spurts without hearing protection can add up to hearing loss.

Also, remember to keep an extra set or hearing protection around for visitors or helpers. It's a good idea to teach your kids to use them. too.
<h2>Prevention as a cure</h2>
There are other steps you can take to preserve your hearing.
<ul>
 	<li>Make sure the tools or machines you are using are well oiled and balanced.</li>
 	<li>Mount machines on carpet pad or rubber washers to reduce vibration and noise.</li>
 	<li>“Soften” the work area by lining it with sound-absorbing materials such as cork, heavy drapes or fiberboard panels that absorb and block noise; install an acoustical tile ceiling and some old indoor/outdoor carpeting.</li>
 	<li>Use sharp blades and bits, they'll cut faster and quieter.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The ghosts that lurk in my closets aren’t scary phantoms from the past; they’re all reminders of current confusion — shoes heaped in a haphazard tangle, favorite shirts lost in a crush of hanging things, and my son’s lost birthday gift finally turning up under a stack of blankets (where I hid it two years ago).

If your closets provide more chaos than convenience, a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/closet-organization-kits/">simple organizing system</a> like we show in this story can be a great improvement. A combination of clothes rods, shelves, and drawers puts everything at your fingertips.

This shelf system is a bread-and-butter project for all do-it-yourselfers. You won't need advanced woodworking tools nor do you have to buy expensive materials This system cost $400, not including the clothes rods.

You'll see how to put this system in a 12-ft. walk-in closet. If you don’t have a closet this large, simply adapt parts of this design to fit your space
<h2>Build instructions</h2>

<h2>Planning your closet space</h2>
The chaos in our closets readily tells us whether we need more shelves, closet rods or drawers. Professional closet designers recommend that you plan around two key elements — drawers and a rod for long, hanging garments. Both need special treatment. Locate the drawers below eye level so you can easily see their contents and where you can open them without obstruction. And make them spacious, at least 16 in from front to back (Fig. A), so they'll hold a lot of stuff.

Long, hanging clothes, like coats and dresses. take extra space because they don‘t fit into the double clothes rod system. where you put one rod about 42 in. above the other. This is a favorite space-saving idea for shorter hanging garments, but you can't use it for long things. So plan for the extra length right away. Count up your long garments and allow about 1-1/2 in. of rod width for each.

As you plan, draw a rough sketch of your closet walls, measure their width and height, and figure out the best position for the drawers and long clothes. Then divide up the remaining space between the shelves and the rods for the short clothes. Jackets, skirts, blouses, shirts, slacks, and suits will hang less than 40 in. long, so you can stack one clothes rod above another to save space. And folded clothes, like sweaters and jeans, shoes, purses, hats, blankets, towels will go on shelves, which you fit into the leftover space.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1325" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/closet-storage-details-1024x1020.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="555" />
<h2>Materials and assembly</h2>
One nice feature of this closet storage system is that you can build it from whatever wood fits your taste and pocketbook. You can fashion a rough, but perfectly functional unit from unpainted No. 2 pine boards, or make it fancy with varnished hardwood (approximately 4x more per board foot).

This storage system uses 3/4-in. birch plywood. The 3/4 in. x 1-ft. wide plywood shelves are strong enough to span about 3 ft. without sagging or needing reinforcement. In addition, plywood is perfectly flat, straight and easy to nail. For finishing. the birch veneer surfaces paint up smoothly, though you could substitute sanded fir plywood (Grade AB) for 30% less cost, or a coarser grade (CD) for 65% less per square foot This project doesn’t use fir because the coarse grain pattern in fir plywood shows through even a good paint job.

Cutting the 4x8 sheets of plywood into strips will be no problem if you use one of the factory edges for a saw guide. (<a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/can-you-cut-plywood-with-a-jigsaw/">See more tips on cutting plywood here</a>.) Set your sheet on a couple of sawhorses, clamp the guide in place, and cut the strips. If you use a sharp blade, cutting in the direction of the grain of the top veneer won’t cause ugly splintering (the grain runs parallel to the 8-ft. side of both plywood faces).

However, cutting across the grain (Photo 2) causes the top veneer to splinter. The solution is to first score your cut line deeply with a utility knife. Then cut slightly (1/64 in.) to the outside (the waste side) of the line.

To make this storage system more attractive, I glued and tacked a decorative strip to the unfinished front edges of the plywood. Any 3/4-in. wide molding from a lumberyard will do, though this is a fancy “triple bead" design cut into solid birch strips with a special router bit (Fig. A). You can save a lot of time if you stain and/or paint all your pieces before nailing them together, though you’ll have to touch them up after assembling the entire system.

The shown photos for step-by-step assembly fall into two parts:
<ol>
 	<li>First, the system was made rigid and strong by nailing together the permanent shelves and upright parts (Photos 3-7).</li>
 	<li>Then, the adjustable shelves, clothes rods, and drawers were added (Photos 8-12).</li>
</ol>
The critical section is the “tower” reserved for drawers. It was assembled and erected first, making sure the sides and bottom were level, plumb, and formed right angles (Photo 4). Otherwise, the drawers won't fit squarely. If your floor isn't flat and level, plane or sand the bottom of the tower‘s vertical sides to level the permanent shelves.

Anchor the tower to the floor with two 6d finish nails and to the wall higher up with a steel angle brace screwed to the permanent shelf and to a wall stud (Photo 5). This adds a measure of safety to keep the shelves from tumbling forward should a 5-year-old climb up after the family pet.

The adjustable shelves rest on four supports that you insert into holes in the vertical sides of the closet system. By drilling more holes, you can move these supports up or down to fit the shelf space needed. At first, it's tempting to drill the sides top to bottom to get maximum shelf flexibility like you see in the commercial systems But after drilling the first few dozen holes, you might just decide that flexibility isn’t so important after all. Choices are great, but you can always drill the additional holes when you need them.

The template shown in Photo 8 makes the job a lot easier and more accurate. Cut a 1/4-in. board the same width as the vertical sides, layout and drill the grid of holes using the dimensions we show, then clamp it to a side, and drill away.

Watch for two problems, though:
<ol>
 	<li>First, most drills chip the plywood veneer as they begin the hole. So use a sharp <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/best-drill-bit-set/">brad point drill bit</a> and begin the hole slowly to minimize this problem.</li>
 	<li>Second, avoid drilling too far or you'll pop out the other side. Wrap a strip of masking tape around the drill bit to use as a depth gauge.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Closet rods</h2>
Clothes hangers have become fairly standardized, so you can comfortably center your closet rod brackets 10-3/4 in. or more from the back wall. And make sure any shelf above the rod clears the rod by at least 1-1/2 in., so you can easily slip the hangers up over the rod.

Metal rods like we show here cost under $10 per foot but don't bend under the weight of clothes. Wood rods are much more economical, but they'll bend under a heavy load. A pair of closet rod brackets cost around than $2.
<h2>Drawers</h2>
Drawer building calls for a bit more accuracy than the rest of the storage system. For a drawer to be square, you have to cut the sides and bottom perfectly square. So saw the pieces precisely. A table saw, though not essential, will make this job easier. We used 1/2-in. birch plywood for the drawer sides and 1/4-in. for the bottoms. Once you’ve cut the pieces, glue and nail the edges together following the detail in Fig. A. The bottom automatically squares up the sides.

Fasten the 3/4-in. drawer front with two screws from the inside. Don‘t glue it: you might want to adjust it later.

Screw the drawer slides to the drawer bottoms and to the tower sides (Photos 11 and 12). If you haven’t worked with slides before, you'll find this bottom-mount type an easy introduction. Half of the screws directly to the drawer bottom. Position the other half carefully on the sides of the tower, so that the drawer fronts are evenly spaced when closed. Remember to keep the slides perfectly level. And if the drawers don’t fit precisely on your first try, don't worry. These slides are very forgiving, and take only a minute to reposition.

Drawers cost more than shelves and closet rods. Figure about $40 in material for each ($25 for plywood. $15/pair for slides).

<ol>
<li><strong>Plunge a clogged drain</strong> with a steady rhythmic motion to provide an alternating pressure and suction on the obstruction. Keep the rim of the plunger cup tight to the sink, and tightly cover the other drain or overflow with a wet rag to prevent air from espacing.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Remove the trap</strong> to clean a drain line with a snake. Loosen slip nuts at both ends of the trap. Slide the hole cover forward and loosen the slip nut behind it that secures the trap arm.</li>

<h2>Tips</h2>

Drains clog up sometimes. It’s a fact of life — probably even in the White House.

Make your first assault on a clogged drain with Drano or a liquid clog dissolver such as Liquid Plumber or S-T Drain Opener. Most of these will pass through standing water. Be careful with this stuff! It can burn your skin or your eyes. Follow the safety instructions on the label exactly.

If a dissolver fails, use the plunger. But be careful that any caustic cleaner remaining in the drain doesn’t splash into your eyes.

Most sinks and tubs have either two drains or an overflow drain, and you have to cover this second opening tightly with a damp rag to generate the necessary suction and pressure with the plunger, as shown in Photo 1.

The flexible wire snake — which you can buy for cheap — is the last resort if the plunger doesn’t work. First try working it down through the sink drain, since the clog might be right in the trap. However, if the clog is farther down the line, you’ll probably need to remove the trap and trap arm, as shown in Photo 2, then feed the snake as far into the drain as necessary to reach the clog.]]></content:encoded>

Did you now that CO may be responsible for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430740/">50% of all fatal poisonings</a>? In this article you’ll learn how to prevent this silent killer from invading your home.

Several hundred people will die this coming year, killed in their homes by an invisible, silent assassin. Thousands more will have their health damaged, perhaps seriously. The cause of all of this human carnage is carbon monoxide, an invisible, odorless gas.

Now I don't mean to scare you, but this is truly scary stuff. When I first began researching this topic, the more I learned, the more I found myself worrying about whether my home’s furnace or water heater — two totally forgettable appliances that we tend to think of only as comfort providers — could instead kill me and my family. I've now taken steps to ensure that it won’t happen, and you need to do the same.

Am I being overly cautious? I don’t think so. Carbon monoxide is not a minor problem. It accounts for half the fatal poisonings in the United States each year, which, depending on the set of statistics you choose to use, means a minimum of 200 to as many as 1,500 deaths per year. A recent Canadian study of 1,000 homes found that three-quarters had some carbon monoxide buildup, 10 percent of them at health-threatening levels. Yet dangerous as it is, few homeowners know about carbon monoxide or how easy it is to guard their homes against its deadly intrusion.

<h2>Carbon monoxide detectors</h2>

<ol>
<li> Looking like every-day smoke detectors, these electronic units have audible alarms to warn you of carbon monoxide. The Ultralert (on left) is a combination smoke/carbon monoxide/natural gas detector requiring 120-volt power. The CoStar (on right) detects only carbon monoxide and uses a nine-volt battery for power.</li>
<li> Place two of the Air Check sensors near the draft hood of the furnace and water heater. The third sensor is used to double-check any sign of backdrafting.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li> Regular checks of the chemical detector spot of this Quantum Eye carbon monoxide detector are necessary to warn you of problems. When the spot changes color, the carbon monoxide level is too high. These detectors last for one year and then must be replaced.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Why it kills</h2>

This gas is deadly because of its extreme attraction to hemoglobin, the main component of red blood cells. Its affinity for hemoglobin is 245 times greater than oxygen's. Carbon monoxide is absorbed by the body only by breathing, the same way we get oxygen.

Hemoglobin combines with oxygen in our lungs, carrying the oxygen throughout our bodies, releasing it to the tissues as needed. But when carbon monoxide is present. it replaces the oxygen. In high enough concentrations, it can kill in minutes.

One of the reasons carbon monoxide poisoning claims so many victims is that its physical symptoms are frequently misdiagnosed by doctors as the flu or whatever bug is going around. It’s no coincidence that most carbon monoxide poisonings occur during the winter, the prime time for colds and flu.

<h2>Carbon monoxide sources</h2>

Carbon monoxide (the chemical symbol is C0) is a by-product of
incomplete combustion. Colorless and odorless, it gives no warning of its presence.

It's impossible to avoid some exposure to carbon monoxide. Your body even produces minute quantities.

Carbon monoxide sources are everywhere.

They include such obvious ones as automobile exhaust fumes, furnaces, the kitchen stove, the water heater, your fireplace, charcoal grills, even your lawn mower.

And such unexpected sources as the vapors of some sources as the vapors of some solvents, such as methylene chloride in some paint strippers.

You can't avoid breathing some carbon monoxide, but as long as the level in the blood is below 2%, there’s no cause for concern.

<h2>Our homes and our health</h2>

As it our homes didn't already have enough sources of carbon monoxide, we tend to make the situation worse in pursuit of <a href"http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/blower-door-test/">energy efficiency</a>. Some houses are simply too tight for safety.

Besides being fighter thanks to more insulation, caulking, insulating window films, and weatherstripping, as thermostats have been turned down, a variety of room heaters have taken their place, or a fireplace or wood stove installed. Or maybe you’ve built an enclosure around the furnace or water heater in the process of remodeling the basement.

If you didn’t provide for adequate fresh air flow, perhaps from outside, you may have created a perfect opportunity for carbon monoxide to build up.

<h2>Clues around the home for excess CO</h2>

Even though carbon monoxide can’t be detected by your senses, sometimes, but not always, there will be other clues to its presence:

<ul>
<li>Persistently stuffy, stale or smelly air that never clears.</li>
<li>Very high humidity, often showing up as moisture on the windows </li>
<li>Soot around the outside of the fire place, furnace or chimney.</li>
<li>No draft in the chimney.</li>
<li>A hot draft from the chimney into the home.</li>
<li>The smell of exhaust fumes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Health-related CO poisoning clues</h2>

Because carbon monoxide poisoning is more of a problem during the winter when heating systems are running and everyone seems to have a cold or the flu, the physical symptoms are often misdiagnosed. Some of those symptoms are:

<ul>
<li>Persistent severe headaches.</li>
<li>Dizziness, blurred vision.</li>
<li>Nausea and vomiting.</li>
<li>Confusion, disorientation, loss of muscle control.</li>
<li>Sleepiness. but never feeling rested.</li>
<li>Rapid heartbeat, pulse or a tightening of the chest.</li>
<li>An abnormal cherry color to the skin.</li>
<li>Chest pain (angina) when exercising.</li>
<li>Fainting, unconsciousness.</li>
<li>Feeling sick and tired at home, but fine once you leave the house.</li>
</ul>

A lot of these symptoms sound just like the last time you had the flu. don’t they? That’s what makes this such a sneaky, hard-to-identify problem. If everyone in the family seems to be experiencing the same illness to some degree (body size and health are both factors that determine when symptoms will arise) and nothing seems to help, ask your doctor to check for carbon monoxide poisoning, immediately.

Ask for a <strong>carboxyhemoglobulin level blood test</strong>. It's the only test that will identify carbon monoxide poisoning. Other routine blood and drug tests won‘t do the job.

High levels of carbon monoxide don’t affect everyone equally Pregnant women, people with heart problems, and children are all more susceptible. Carbon monoxide also has a stronger effect at higher altitudes because the air has less oxygen in it to begin with, allowing the carbon monoxide to bind even more effectively with the hemoglobin.

The treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning is usually just fresh air and time. In severe cases, however, the patient will be placed in a chamber with oxygen under high pressure. While carbon monoxide doesn't accumulate in your system, long-term exposure causes permanent damage to the nervous system.

<h2>What not to do</h2>

To keep carbon monoxide from becoming a problem, keep these common-sense rules in mind:

<ul>
<li>Don’t sit in a parked car with the engine running and the windows closed, or let the engine idle for long periods of time in a closed garage.</li>
<li>Never use a charcoal grill indoors.</li>
<li>Never use a kitchen stove or oven for heating purposes.</li>
<li>Never use an unvented gas heater indoors</li>
<li>Avoid extensive use of kerosene heaters — better yet don’t use them at all.</li>
<li>Don’t put furnaces and Water heaters in an enclosure unless you provide adequate ventilation, perhaps ducted in from outside. Your local utility can give you guidelines on what to do.</li>
<li>Don’t use LP gas lamps, heaters or gasoline lanterns indoors or in an RV, unless they’re vented to the outside.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What you should do</h2>

Besides knowing what not to do (above) there's a number of steps you can take to ensure you won‘t have a problem:

<ul>
<li>Check your chimney every fall (or have it done for you) for signs of blockage, such as bird’s nests.</li>
<li>Have your chimney cleaned annually, before the start of the heating season and especially if you frequently use a fireplace or wood-burning stove.</li>
<li>Have all heating appliances checked for proper function by a professional. preferably on an annual basis. The check should include a visual inspection of the furnace’s heat exchanger, all vents, fan motor and belts, and fuel shutoff switch. Your local utility company usually offers this inspection at low cost. To avoid a lengthy wait, schedule the inspection before the heating season begins.</li>
<li>Make sure the water heater is properly vented with no leakage (see “Can Your House Breathe?” below) .</li>
<li>If you've recently remodeled your home, especially with improvements that make it more energy efficient, have the Carbon Monoxide level checked by the utility company to ensure that you still have adequate ventilation.</li>
<li>If your furnace is enclosed, make sure it has access to enough outside combustion air. Again, your utility company can provide specific advice.</li>
<li>Have your family vehicles’ mufflers and tailpipes checked, replacing them if they're worn out or loose fitting.</li>
<li>On any appliance, learn to recognize a properly adjusted burner flame. The flame should burn crisp and blue. If it’s orange, it needs adjustment — get professional assistance.</li>
<li>The older the furnace, the more likely you'll have problems. If you need a new furnace, or are purchasing one for a new home, choose a “sealed combustion” model. (Note: Don't confuse this type with versions classified as “induced-draft” or “direct-vent.” They’re not the same.) All of the major manufacturers offer them. These units draw air directly into the combustion chamber from the outside. and vent the exhaust gases straight back out.</li>
<li>Sometimes you can retrofit your present heating system with either a power venter (gas furnaces) for about $350 to $550, or a delayed-action solenoid valve for about $200 on oil-fired furnaces. Power venters move exhaust gases directly outside through a side wall. The delayed-action solenoid stops the flow of oil until the blower goes on.</li>
<li>If your home is very airtight (most homes aren’t). you may want to install an air-to-air heat exchanger, also called a heat-recovery ventilator. It ensures that your home won't become depressurized, which leads to backdrafting.</li>
<li>If you install or have a new water heater installed for you, make sure the job was done right by doing a backdraft check afterward.</li>
<li>Install one of the electronic or chemical carbon monoxide detectors as cheap insurance.</li>
<li>
Periodically, conduct a backdrafting check.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Detectors – the best defense</h2>

Even if you take all of the precautions outlined so far, there's nothing that guarantees the furnace’s heat exchanger won't develop a leak two minutes after the inspection. In the past that was a risk you had to run, but not anymore.

Just as smoke detectors are now common in homes and apartments, Carbon monoxide detectors, sometimes paired with a smoke detector, are now available. The accompanying photos provide help in choosing a detector that meets your needs and budget.

Least expensive but requiring a regular monitoring are the small chemical detectors. These use carbon monoxide-sensitive chemicals that change color when exposed to a certain level of the gas. Typically costing under $20, they must be replaced at least every year. Most important, you need to develop the habit of checking them regularly, looking for that telltale color change.

Electronic detectors are more expensive, but you don't have to monitor them. Just like the smoke detectors that they resemble, their alarms will sound if a certain level of carbon monoxide is present. One model, the Ultralert, is a combination smoke, carbon monoxide, and natural gas (methane) detector. The Ultralert is slightly larger than most smoke detectors, and requires a 120-volt power source.

<h2>Can your house breathe?</h2>

Homes need to breathe because fresh air is necessary for the furnace, water heater, and stove. If there isn’t enough fresh air available inside the home, it will be pulled into the home down the furnace or fireplace chimney. This is called “backdrafting.” Backdrafting reverses the chimney's normal siphoning effect, so all the carbon monoxide produced by the furnace and water heater stays inside the house instead of going up the chimney.

To determine if your home is receiving enough fresh air, conduct this test:

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/carbon-monoxide-can-your-house-breathe-01.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="403" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1340" />

<ul>
<li>Close all doors, windows, and fireplace dampers.</li>
<li>Turn on all exhaust fans, such as those in the kitchen, bathrooms, attic and your clothes dryer (whether gas or electric).</li>
<li>Turn on all vented gas appliances, such as the furnace and water heater.</li>
<li>Wait 10 minutes for drafts to stabilize.</li>
<li>Hold a lighted wood match or incense stick below the furnace draft hood air intake (typically on one side of the furnace or an open section at ductwork near the furnace). If the smoke is pulled up toward the draft head, this indicates sufficient fresh air.</li>
<li>If the match flame goes out, or the incense smoke is blown away from the draft hood, backdrafting exists. Immediately call your local utility for assistance.</li>
<li>Repeat this test on the gas water heater.</li>
<li>If you have a fireplace, start a fire in it and wait until it’s well underway. Then check for backdrafting again at your furnace and gas water heater draft hoods. If it's present, you must install a duct to provide the fireplace with air from outside.</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you're like most homeowners, you know that the trees on your property should receive an occasional pruning. However, the task is usually put off until, for the umpteenth time, you bump into a low-hanging branch while mowing the lawn. "That's it." you say. “Tree. your time has come."

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pruning-trees.jpg" alt="" width="973" height="810" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1344" />

Typically, the tree is then attacked by a variety of tools. with limbs hacked off in a mostly random manner. When a large enough pile of branches has accumulated, the job is pronounced finished.

Unfortunately, in some cases, so is the tree.

Indiscriminate and unknowledgeable pruning can kill a tree. A dead tree is dangerous to have around, costly to both remove and replace, and lowers the value of your property.

But strangely enough. pruning a tree is one of the best things you can do for it. It’s an important and essential step in maintaining your trees' health. The trick is knowing when and where to prune.

Every time you make a cut on a tree, you should have a reason for that cut. This article will give you those reasons by explaining the basics of pruning, some corrective tree surgery you can do. when to prune and what tools to use.

This topic, however. is sufficiently complex that I advise you to read any of the books in my reading list at the end of this article.

<h2>Why you prune</h2>

What’s hard for most people to understand is that pruning, properly done, strengthens rather than weakens the tree. It's one of the best things you can do for your tree.

<h3>Benefits of Pruning:</h3>

<ul>
<li>it ensures good growth when transplanting or planting a new tree.</li>
<li>it controls tree form.</li>
<li>it produces a better appearance.</li>
<li>it keeps the tree healthy.</li>
<li>it can rejuvenate a tree.</li>
<li>it produces more and better fruit.</li>
<li>it removes branches that endanger property or interfere with overhead wires or nearby structures.</li>
</ul>

There are limits, however. A common mistake is to neglect a tree for many years. and then in a flurry of activity (such as after reading this article), prune too severely. Nor will pruning significantly alter the shape of a mature tree, especially a conifer.

<h2>Nature’s plumbing system</h2>

To prune effectively. it's essential to understand how plants respond to pruning cuts. Fig. A identifies the parts of the tree to which this article will refer.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pruning-trees-01-terminology-997x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="572" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1345" />

Think of each stem (twig, branch or trunk) as a channel — a plumbing system — carrying water and nutrients for growth. By diverting this flow of water and nutrients (shutting off one faucet, opening another) you’re able to shape your trees. stopping growth in one direction or speeding it in another more beneficial manner.

In pruning, the most important parts of a tree are the buds (see inset, Fig. A). The direction a plant will grow is determined by these buds. There are three types of buds: lateral, terminal, and latent.

When pruning, select the bud that will grow in the direction you want. Fig. B shows how growth will occur in the same branch pruned differently. If you want more outside branches (ones that point away from the trunk).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pruning-trees-02-same-branch-1024x484.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="263" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1346" />

Choose buds that point to the outside of the plant. These are usually the most desirable anyhow. because they won't interfere with the interior of the tree.

The “terminal” (or end) bud continues the outward or upward growth of the branch. If a terminal bud is removed, the next closest lateral bud inherits its strength and growth. In short, removing the terminal bud causes the growth of side branches.

Buds on the sides of branches are called "lateral" buds. These buds develop into leaves and eventually into scaffold branches. If the lateral buds are removed, growth is transferred into the terminal bud.

Buds that lie dormant for many years are called “latent” buds. They are the tree‘s insurance policy against damage. They may only start to grow after the tree has sustained damage to other branches, and it needs to reestablish the delicate equilibrium of crown size to roots.

<h2>Start them when they’re young</h2>

Pruning should begin when the tree is first planted.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pruning-trees-03-new-tree.jpg" alt="" width="359" height="685" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1347" />

Specifically, you:

<ol>
<li><strong>Prune away broken or girdling roots back to the healthy wood.</strong> Roots that wrap around the base of the tree are girdling roots. Eventually, a girdling root could kill the tree. However, it the new tree was sold growing in a large pot or tub, you probably need not make any compensating root pruning.</li>
<li><strong>Remove broken or damaged branches.</strong> These branches may be diseased; removal keeps the infection from spreading to the good wood.</li>
<li><strong>Prune to compensate for the transplanting.</strong> Before a tree is transplanted. there is a natural, healthy balance in size between the roots and crown (the top of the tree). These two parts rely on each other for manufacturing food for the tree. In the process of transplanting, many of the roots are severed. To help restore the tree back to its balanced state, parts of the crown should be pruned. A rule of thumb is to prune the new tree back by one-fourth. First. identity the leader (see Fig. A) you want to preserve, and then prune back the leader and lateral branches by about one-fourth (It the planted tree is 4 ft. tall. this would mean cutting away about 12 in. from other branches.) Fig. C shows what I mean.</li>
</ol>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pruning-trees-05-06-young-forked-tree.jpg" alt="" width="735" height="531" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1349" />

Your goal in the tree’s first year is to make sure it survives the transplanting, not to preserve every leaf and skinny branch. Prune in order to establish the strong central leader you want, but also be a bit cautious. You don't want so many wounds that the tree can't heal and grow.

<h2>How to prune</h2>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pruning-trees-07-correct-technique.jpg" alt="" width="743" height="683" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1350" />

First, study Fig. G to learn the correct cutting techniques:

<ol>
<li>preventing damage to the bark and bark ridges.</li>
<li>leaving a clean. slightly angled cut, which produces the smallest wound.</li>
<li>avoiding long stumps, which are avenues fdr insect infestation and rot </li>
</ol>

Wound closure comes fastest when the cuts are smooth. So keep your tools sharpened so that you'll get a clean cut without rough edges.

Make cuts next to, but not into, the branch bark ridge, which is located on the upper side of the branch. Cut at an angle to avoid leaving too much cut surface exposed. Leaving this bark ridge collar area and a smaller exposed surface will allow the cut to heal healthier and quicker.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pruning-trees-04-thick-branches.jpg" alt="" width="388" height="313" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1348" />

Larger cuts, as when thinning, require two cuts to be made prior to the final cut (see Fig. D). This eliminates the problem of the branch ripping or tearing the bark on the underside as the branch falls. You may want to attach a rope to help support the large branch, then make the first cut on the underside of the branch about 12 in. from the trunk. Cut about one-third of the way through the branch, stopping before the saw binds. Make the second cut on the top of the branch about 1 in. out from the first cut. Keep cutting until the branch breaks free. Then cutaway the remaining stump.

In shortening in branch or twig, cut it back to an existing branch that you've determined is appropriate, or back to a lateral bud or dormant bud (dormant buds are at the base of all leaves). When cutting to a bud, cut to within about 1/4 in. of the bud, and as always, make the cut at a slight angle for quicker healing.

<h2>What to prune</h2>

You now know why you're pruning and how to do it right. Now it's time to examine your trees for:

<ul>
<li><strong>Dead or dying branches.</strong> Cut them off back to another healthy branch, or back to the main trunk.</li>
<li><strong>Branch stubs.</strong> Remove all too-long stubs back to the nearest healthy branch or trunk.</li>
<li><strong>To correct the tree’s shape </strong> (see Figs. E. F and G). With younger trees, it’s possible to do a bit of corrective surgery to prevent the tree from developing two widely spaced, weak, forked branches (Figs. E and F). The ideal tree is shown in Fig. H. It has a strong central leader, and the scaffold limbs are spaced along the trunk with no two of them directly above and shading another branch.<br>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pruning-trees-08-ideal-tree.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="682" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1351" />

</li>
<li><strong>Branches growing too close together.</strong> Too many branches too close together stunt the tree’s growth and spoil its appearance. Correcting the situation is referred to as thinning, and since you're removing whole branches, refer to Fig. D for the correct, three-step technique.<br>
Thinning opens up the tree to let in the air, light and rain necessary for the leaves on the inside and the lower portions of the plant to grow properly. Thinning also reduces the area where snow can build up and break limbs.</li>
<li><strong>Rubbing branches.</strong> Remove any branches that are rubbing against each other. These branches create an open wound where insects can enter and disease can start. If untreated, a large portion of the tree can be lost.</li>
<li><strong>Remove suckers and water sprouts</strong> (see Fig. A). Suckers are the ones at the base and trunk of the tree: water sprouts grow vertical to the trunk. They're unattractive, and they weaken the tree.</li>
<li><strong>Weak crutches</strong> (see Fig. J). Remove branches that have weak or nary row-angle (less than about 30 degrees) crotches. Weak crotch branches are the most likely to tear away, damaging the bark and nearby branches.<br>
<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pruning-trees-09-weak-branches.jpg" alt="" width="358" height="407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1352" />
</li>
<li><strong>Dangerous branches</strong>. Prune to protect people and property. Eliminate branches that are, or may be, on their way to interfering with overhead power lines; weak branches that overhang play areas, houses, or anyplace frequented by people; and low branches that make the tree climbable, attracting kids.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How do I prune conifers?</h2>

Trimming conifers, such as pine, juniper, and spruce, leaves a lot of people cold. They'll blithely prune a maple or oak, but sidestep a conifer because they can‘t figure out what to cut.

There's an important distinction that has to be made when dealing with conifers. With conifers you must both prune and shear. Pruning controls the tree's shape and form; shearing controls the new growth. Pruning, therefore, is removal of plant pans that grew prior to the current season; shearing is the removal of a portion of the current season's growth,

Pruning a conifer should be confined to dead or broken branches. or limbs that are interfering with buildings, power lines or such.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pruning-trees-10-conifers.jpg" alt="" width="355" height="393" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1353" />

Shearing a conifer is done while the new needles (referred to as “candles") are about three-quarters grown and before this new growth has hardened and become woody, Fig. K shows the lighter green of the new growth candles — what you’d shear — Compared to the darker color of the older growth.

A conifer's new growth should be sheared just after it is completed, usually in late spring or very early summer (see Fig. K). Usually the new growth is a lighter shade of green than the previous growth, and is situated at the end of the branch. Shearing off about one-third of the new growth each year will keep the conifers growing slowly and within their intended space. Shear when the new growth is still soft. If sheared after the new growth has hardened, new buds won’t form and the tips become dead twigs.

Shear in the evening, after the tree has been watered, using sharp shears, to help avoid the problem of needle burn (also called “shear burn“), which occurs when a too-dry conifer is pruned.

<h2>Fruit trees are special</h2>

Fruit trees are “working trees," so to speak, and your approach to them must be different. Fruit-bearing trees won’t always have a strong central leader as preferred for most other trees. In fact, commercial growers prune their orchards in a variety of styles in order to maximize fruit production.

Strong scaffold branches should be the primary result of pruning. Keep the tree’s branch structure fairly open so that light and air can reach all parts. This prevents diseases and also preserves the fruiting ability of lower limbs. The crowns of fruit trees are kept low to make it easier for pruning, spraying, and harvesting.

Each fruit tree type has different requirements. Please refer to any of the books in the “Additional Reading" list at the end.

<h2>When to prune</h2>

Okay, you now know the why, the how, and the what. You‘re all primed to make life better for every tree in your neighborhood. But hold on. the time may not be right.

The consensus is that the best time to prune living branches (dead and dying branches can be pruned anytime) is late in the dormant season (late winter), or very early in the spring prior to the beginning of growth.

Technically. most trees can be pruned at any time, but some trees are more susceptible to disease and infestation if pruned during the summer months. For example. elms and oaks are best pruned during December, January or February to reduce the chance of Dutch elm disease and oak wilt developing. By pruning during the colder months, wounds can heal before the hot and humid periods provide a starting point for fungal growth.

Some trees bleed. This free-flowing sap escapes after pruning or when branch damage occurs. It may look bad, but it usually causes no harm to the plant, as long as it doesn’t attract insects. These types of trees are best pruned during the dormant period.

Water sprouts and weak branches can be removed at any time during the summer months. Any other pruning during the summer is generally not recommended, except with newly planted trees.

<h2>Treating the wound</h2>

Contrary to earlier beliefs, tree paint and wound dressings don't do any good. The US Department of Agriculture’s Forestry Service specifically advises against their use because numerous studies have shown that they don’t stop decay or prevent rot. Trees have been healing their own wounds for millions of years, and there’s no reason to interfere with this natural process

<h2>The right tools make all the difference</h2>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pruning-trees-tools.jpg" alt="" width="669" height="608" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1354" />

Second only to misunderstanding the how-to at tree pruning, is the confusion about what tools to use. Too many people figure that "wood is wood" and start pruning with either a roaring chain saw or a Carpenter’s saw. Or worse.

The results won't be satisfactory, and you'll likely damage the tree to boot. Using the right tools lets you make the cuts described in this story, and also reduces the level of effort. A modest investment (perhaps no more than $80) in shears and pruning saw, and rental as necessary for other tools, will let you properly maintain your trees.

When pruning small trees, the single most important piece at equipment is a pair of good-quality pruning shears ($25 to $50). Using this tool early in a tree’s life will greatly reduce the amount at corrective pruning that the tree will require as it matures. With the shears or a scissors-type hand pruner, you’ll be able to cut very close to the trunk. Position the thin blade of the shear on the trunk side to keep the resulting stub as short as possible. Shears are designed to cut branches up to 1/2 in. thick.

When you start having to twist and strain to make a cut, than you’re trying to cut too large a branch, and you need lapping shears (about $45 to $100). Loppers eon cut branches up to about 2 in. in diameter depending on the size of the blade opening.

Branches that are too large for lapping shears should he handled with a pruning saw. Never use a conventional shop saw — they require much more effort, the teeth clog quickly, and they do a poor job.
Pruning saws are available in rigid and folding models, with straight or curved blades. For smaller branches, a curved blade is best because the saw cuts on the pull stroke. Large, straight-blade, rigid tree saws are used for larger cuts. Avoid saws with teeth on both sides at the blades

For higher branches, you have two choices — a good-quality step or extension ladder with someone anchoring it to the ground as you work, or it you feel uncomfortable or unsafe with this method, pale pruners are the answer. You can purchase them for from $70 to $120. There are two types available. One has a small curved tree saw at the end that can handle small as well as large branches; the other version has a cord- or rod-operated lever-action pruning shear at the end.

Be very careful when using the saw type of pole pruner an small branches, because it's difficult to make a proper cut —— the branch will rip away, taking bark with it. To avoid this problem, use a pole pruner. Pole pruners are available in various lengths, but 8 ft. is typical. The poles can be made out of aluminum or wood, and are either one-piece or collapsible.

Never put yourself at risk. When dealing with large trees and branches, hire a professional. No tree is worth risking your life over.

Exercise extreme caution when using saws, poles or ladders near any overhead power lines. Also check so make sure that any branch you cut, or that may be ripped off when another branch is cut, won’t fall into an overhead power line. Call the utility company if there is any question about your safety in doing the work.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>How to Remove old-fashioned Milk Paint (the simple way)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you have an old painted chair and want to refinish it, perhaps you will find the paint resisting to every kind of stripper. You may try pastes and liquids, old-fashioned lye and new-fangled water-base strippers — nothing will work. You might not even be able to scrape the paint off.

Don’t despair! There’s an almost magical solution: <strong>ordinary household ammonia</strong>. It should take that old paint right off.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1358" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/removing-old-fashioned-milk-paint.jpg" alt="" width="479" height="655" />

The paint you’re having trouble with is almost certainly an old-fashioned milk paint. Rural folks, especially in the Northeast, made it using milk, linseed oil and a natural pigment like lime or rust-colored soil. You can ﬁnd it on furniture and house trim dating from the 1700s to mid-1800s. Though crude, milk paint is actually quite durable, though it could produce only soft colors (because of the milky base) and didn’t have any gloss. As you discovered, it’s also impervious to normal shippers.

(<strong>PS: If the original milk paint is in good condition, a piece of furniture is probably worth quite a bit more with the original paint on than it would be stripped.</strong>)

		<title>How to make a Frame out of Wooden Molding (step-by-step with pictures)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you're a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/new-hobby-woodworking/">beginning woodworker</a>, picture framing is an ideal project — it requires only simple tools and inexpensive materials, but it gives you quick results. It’s a skill you can practice, too, and maybe even screw up at first, without any great loss of time or money.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1371" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/picture-framing-small.jpg" alt="" width="472" height="482" />

If you’re a seasoned woodworker or DIYer, picture framing is a handy skill just because of the savings. You can save up to 50 percent on the cost of professional framing — even more if you make your own moldings (see section below). For me, that savings often makes the difference between leaving some sentimental treasure tucked away in a drawer and getting it framed and hung on the wall.

So get out your tools, collect a few pieces of art, and set up your family frame shop.
<h2>The tools you’ll need</h2>
Making a picture frame requires only a few basic and inexpensive tools. You'll need:
<ul>
 	<li>tape measure</li>
 	<li><a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-drill-driver-kit/">drill</a></li>
 	<li>pair of pliers</li>
 	<li>hammer</li>
 	<li>nail set</li>
</ul>
You'll also need a <strong>clamp</strong> for gluing the pieces of molding together at the corners. I recommend using a small <strong>band clamp</strong> (Photo 2), which is the least expensive option ($17 or so). and gives excellent results. You can also use miter clamps (the kind that grip two pieces of wood together at a right angle), but these clamps are more expensive and a little trickier to use. Experts use them, though, because they’re faster.

Finally, you'll need a <strong>miter box and a fine-tooth saw</strong> to cut 45-degree corners on the frame pieces. They are super cheap. If you own a miter saw, or a table saw, go ahead and use it instead.
<h2>First, prepare the artwork</h2>
Before you even think about cutting and assembling a frame, the artwork must be properly backed and matted.

The backer is a piece of stiff corrugated cardboard, foam core, or similar material that goes behind the artwork to keep it flat (see below). The mat serves as a border for the artwork.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1368" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/picture-framing-fig-a-1-frame-cross-section-1024x767.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="417" />

Have your local frame shop or art supply store cut the mat and backing for your artwork. They'll help you choose appropriate materials, they’ll do it right, and the cost is only slightly more than what you'd pay for the materials alone (around $20 to $30).
<h2>Choose the molding</h2>
You can buy picture frame moldings in 6- to 1O—ft. lengths, either finished or unfinished. Shop for them at art supply stores, home centers, through the internet, or from your local frame shop.

The cost will vary depending on the type of wood, the molding size, and the intricacy of the molded profile. You can generally expect to pay $3 to $9 a foot. Buy a bit more than you need in case you cut a piece too short.
<h2>Cut the pieces to length</h2>
You should do all your measuring, marking and cutting on the outside edge of the molding.

Start by measuring how wide your molding is, not including the rabbet (Fig. A). The rabbet is the notched area in the back of the molding where the artwork is placed.

Then measure the width and length of your prepared artwork, and add two times the molding width (not counting the rabbet) to each dimension.

Finally, add an extra 1/8 in. to each dimension so the backed and matted artwork fits easily inside the frame.

Mark the lengths on the outside edges of the moldings and cut the 45-degree corners in a miter box (Photo 1).

When all four pieces are cut, check to be sure the sides are exactly the same length and the top and bottom pieces are exactly the same. too. This guarantees that the frame will be square when it's assembled.
<h2>Glue the frame together</h2>
First, test-fit your mitered joints by clamping them together with a band clamp (Photo 2).

If the joints fit well, loosen the clamp, apply yellow carpenter's glue to the joints, then clamp the frame together again. Apply enough clamping pressure to close the mitered corners. If the joints aren't tight, file them carefully for a good fit.

Allow the glue to cure overnight, then remove the clamp. Drill pilot holes (Photo 3). then hammer 3/4-in. brads through the sides and into the mitered joints. Use a nail set to sink the brad heads slightly below the surface of the wood.

If your frame is unfinished, go ahead and finish it now. When the finish is dry (or if you‘ve used prefinished molding), fill the holes with colored soft putty made for finished wood.
<h2>Purchase the glass</h2>
I had a hardware store cut single-strength window glass for these picture frames. It’s cheap, distortion-free and suitable for most artwork.

Special types of non-glare glass and ultraviolet light filtering glass (known as conservation clear glass) can be cut to fit your frame at glass supply stores and picture frame supply stores, for about 50 percent more than window glass.

Take your frame to the store and have them cut the glass to fit the frame.
<h2>Mount the artwork in the frame</h2>
Start by cleaning the glass twice on each side. Use a glass cleaning solution and wipe the glass dry with crumpled newspaper. I know it sounds strange, but it really works!

Lay the matted and backed artwork face up on a table. Place the glass on top of the artwork Carefully remove any dust from the glass and artwork with a clean paint brush.

Place the frame over the glass and artwork, then reach under the frame and lift everything up into the frame. Reexamine the pieces for any remaining dust and clean again if necessary. Then flip the frame over and secure the artwork in the frame by inserting 3/4-in. brads fight against the backer and into the frame, using a pair of arc-joint (Channellock-type) pliers (Photo 5).
<h2>Cover the back and attach the hanging wire</h2>
You should glue a piece of brown kraft paper over the frame’s back to keep dust from getting in.

Start by cutting a piece of kraft paper slightly larger than the frame. Place a small head of white or yellow glue around the back edge of the frame, then press the kraft paper onto it (Photo 6). Let the glue dry, and then cut away the overhanging paper with a sharp utility knife. Cut about 1/8 in. in from the frame's outside edge.

Purchase screw eyes and picture frame hanging wire and hooks appropriate to the weight of your framed artwork. Drill pilot holes and insert the screw eyes, 1/4 to 1/3 of the way down the sides. Attach the wire as shown below.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1369" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/picture-framing-fig-a-2-wiring-detail-1024x527.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="287" />

Place felt or plastic stick-on bumpers (available at hardamre stores) at the bottom corners of the frame to protect the wall the frame hangs on, then hang the frame. A small level will help you get the frame straight on the wall.
<h2>Steps for making picture frames</h2>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Cut 45-degree corners</strong> on your molding using a fine-tooth saw and a miter box. Make all measurements on the outside of the molding according to the article.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1362" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/picture-framing-1.jpg" alt="" width="647" height="519" />
<ol start="2">
 	<li><strong>Clamp the molding pieces together</strong> with a band clamp. Protect the corners with small pieces of cardboard. Use carpenter’s glue to hold the joints.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
 	<li><strong>Drill pilot holes</strong> and insert 3/4-in. brads through the sides and into the miter joints. These help reinforce the glue faint.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1364" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/picture-framing-3.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="405" />
<ol start="4">
 	<li><strong>Cut picture frame molding</strong> with a router mounted in a router table. (See below.)</li>
 	<li><strong>Use 3/4-in. brads</strong> to hold the artwork in place. You can insert them with a pair of pliers, but be sure to protect the wood as shown.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1366" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/picture-framing-5.jpg" alt="" width="541" height="426" />
<ol start="6">
 	<li><strong>Glue a piece of brown kraft paper</strong> to the back of the home to keep dust out. Cut away the excess paper after the glue has dried.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1367" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/picture-framing-6.jpg" alt="" width="541" height="394" />
<h2>Making your own molding</h2>
With a table saw and a router table you can make your own picture frame moldings with an almost infinite number of profiles. It's a great way to use up extra lumber and save money on framing. See below some examples:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1370" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/picture-framing-fig-b-shop-made-moldings.jpg" alt="" width="731" height="852" />

First, decide what size rabbet you will need. For thin artwork, like photographs and posters, a rabbet that’s 1/2 in. deep x 3/16 in. wide works fine. For convex or uneven artwork, the rabbet must be deeper and wider.

Cut the wood pieces to width and thickness, leaving them as long as possible. Cut the rabbets on a table saw. Use finger boards or other hold-down devices to keep the moldings flat on the saw's table, and use your saw guards.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1365" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/picture-framing-4.jpg" alt="" width="383" height="377" />

Use the router table to put decorative edges on the rabbeted strips (Photo 4). Test your setup with scrap wood before you begin, and cut extra molding to allow for waste. You can use several bits in succession to make a wide variety of profiles.

		<title>How to fix a squeaky carpeted floor (without damaging the carpet)</title>
		<link>http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/fix-squeaky-floor/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If your carpeted floor squeak when you walk on it, perhaps you may wonder if there is a way of correcting it without damaging the carpeting. 

Squeaking is produced by wood rubbing on wood or nails rubbing on wood — and for many people it’s as irritating as fingernails on a blackboard.

The three most common causes of squeaks are:

<ol>
<li>loose or misted floor joists,</li>
<li>a loose subfloor, and</li>
<li>a hardwood floor pulling away from the subfloor.</li>
</ol>

If your your floor joists are exposed in the basement, you’re lucky; it should be easy to fix your squeaks without pulling up carpeting.

First, watch your floors from the basement as someone upstairs walks on them. Does the subfloor move or do the joists twist slightly? If not, chances are good that your hardwood flooring has come loose from the subfloor. The best way to fix that problem is to drill holes through the subfloor in the location of the squeak and use 1-in. or 1-1/4 in. screws to pull the floor tight to the subfloor (see figure).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/how-to-fix-a-squeaky-carpeted-floor.jpg" alt="" width="778" height="528" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1374" />

If you didn’t have carpeting, you could also drive 16d finish nails through the hardwood floor at an angle, set the heads, then putty. Pairs of nails angled in opposite directions give the best grip.

If you see the subfloor moving as someone walks, then it’s not making firm contact with the joists, or a twisted joist is fitting a little under the weight. If you see twisted joists, make sure the wooden or metal diagonal bridging between the joists is tight. If extra support is needed, put in solid bridging (see figure).

If there are places where the subfloor isn’t touching the joists, drive wooden shims with a little glue on them between the top of the joists and the subfloor (see figure). If this is occurring over several feet of the joist, place a 2x4 along the joist, prop it lightly against the subfloor with another board, then nail or screw the 2x4 to the joist (see figure).

Be very gentle when you use either of these techniques, because they can pop your floor up in other places if you apply too much pressure. The goal is to make tight contact, not to push up the floor.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Do I need a water softener system?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Soft water cuts energy costs, uses less soap, makes housework easier, and helps you look and feel better. Here’s how a softener works and how to tell if your home needs one.

Hard water is a problem that affects a majority of the people in the United States. Water in 85 percent of the country is hard enough that softening is either required or recommended. Take a look at the map of hard water concentration to see how your area is rated.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/water-softeners-us-hardness-map.jpg" alt="" width="924" height="611" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1377" />

Before you read more on how a water softener works and without taking a chemistry course, let’s see how water hardness occurs and the problems associated with it. This will help in determining if you need (or want) a water softener.

<h2>What is hard water?</h2>

Hard water is how we refer to water that contains the hardness minerals calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg). Rain water, by contrast, is naturally soft because these minerals aren't present. That's why people used to collect it and use it for washing clothes.

Rain water doesn’t stay soft for long. As it filters down through the earth and becomes part of the ground water supply, it picks up minerals of hardness (Ca and Mg).

<h2>Why be concerned?</h2>

The two main problems associated with hard water are the formation of soap curd and scale. These conditions can damage appliances such as dishwashers, make clothing dull and dingy looking, and clog water pipes.

Soap curd is an insoluble material formed when the hardness minerals react with soaps and detergents. Soap curds deposit themselves on fabrics, dulling the colors and making whites look grey or yellow. They also cling to the fabric fibers, making them brittle and shortening the life of the material.

Because soaps and detergents combine with the hardness minerals and form soap curds, you end up using more soap and detergent. Hard water also leaves behind soap scum rings and rusty stains. This makes cleaning more difficult and time-consuming.

Scale formation is the other serious problem. Scale is formed when hard water is heated. Scale build-up gradually coats the interior of pipes, water heaters, boilers and appliances, reducing water flow and efficiency.

Two other concerns:

<ol>
<li>just as hard water leaves a film behind on clothes, there’s a similar film residue on your skin after bathing, and</li>
<li>hard water sometimes tastes bad.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Why hard water is costly</h2>

A study by the University of New Mexico showed that it took much more energy to heat hard water. Gas water heaters warming soft water used 29 percent less energy than the same heaters warming hard water. Electric water heaters using salt water consumed 21 percent less energy.

You might be able to shrug your shoulders at that and absorb the one-third greater cost, but there’s another expense: extra time spent on housework. The staining of sinks, toilets and tubs makes them considerably harder to clean; and if the stain can't be removed, your only alternative is replacing the fixture.

<h2>How to combat hard water</h2>

There are several ways to reduce water hardness: deionization, distillation, reverse osmosis and cation exchange. The method that’s used most often, and best suited for residential use is cation exchange.

<h3>Understanding cation exchange</h3>

The principles of a cation exchange system are not very complex. A cation is a positively charged ion. An ion is an electrically charged atom or group of atoms.

To soften water, the hardness ions (Ca and Mg) are exchanged with sodium (Na) ions. This exchange occurs in the resin bed, during the softening cycle.

<h2>What’s in a softener?</h2>

An ion exchange water softener is made up of four basic components:

<ul>
<li><strong>resin tank</strong>: It contains the resin bed.</li>
<li><strong>resin bed</strong>: This is where the real action takes place. The resin bed is made up of a tiny bead-like material composed of styrene and divinylbenzene. (The actual resin beads are less than 1/32 of an inch in diameter.) The resin beads attract and hold positively charged ions (Na), but will give them up (exchange them) whenever the bead encounters another positively charged ion (Ca and Mg), for which it has greater affinity. Think of it as “The Dating Game.”</li>
<li><strong>brine tank</strong>: This holds the water and dissolved salt solution (brine) that is necessary to perform the ion exchange.</li>
<li><strong>control valve</strong>: It determines the direction of the flow of water through the resin tank or from one location to another during the various softening cycles.</li>
</ul>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/water-softeners.jpg" alt="" width="478" height="725" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1378" />

There comes a point when the resin can no longer soften the water. It becomes exhausted. If no new chemical reaction (recharging) is begun, the Ca and Mg ions flow through untouched and the water is no longer softened.

<h2>The recharging process</h2>

In recharging (regenerating) the water softener, what you’re doing is reversing the ion exchange mention. The Ca and Mg ions are driven off of the resin beads and replaced with Na ions.

Accomplishing this regeneration requires that the resin beads be washed with a strong salt water solution (referred to as “brine"). The excessive concentration of salt forces the Ca and Mg ions to be released and they’re discharged as waste during the backwashing cycle.

The beads are then ready to once again remove Ca and Mg from the water.

<h3>Sounds like a lot of work?</h3>

In the not too distant past, recharging the softener was a chore. Today, however, the softeners are fully automatic and extremely reliable. The regeneration process comes on automatically, with your only task the occasional filling of the salt storage tank.

<h2>Do you need a water softener?</h2>

First, you should have your water supply’s hardness level tested. If it’s tested by someone who sells softeners, you can bet you’ll need to buy one. If it’s tested by an independent testing laboratory, or by a firm recommended by your county or municipal health department, maybe not. (You can perform a preliminary hardness test, see T-I-Y section below).

Most manufacturers of water softening equipment will test your water free of charge. (Remember, though, they‘re in the business to sell, so be ready to endure the sales pitch.) The salesperson will come to your house, draw a sample of tap water and usually be able to determine the water hardness right in your home.

Another source is through your local health department. They should be able to recommend a testing lab that will provide you with accurate test results for a nominal fee. (A water hardness test usually runs about $20-30). One nice thing about these folks is they usually aren't trying to sell you a water softener.

<h2>What the test tells you</h2>

Water hardness is expressed in “grains per gallon” (abbreviated as GPG). The term is a measurement of the number of grains of a given substance in one US gallon of water. Water supplies in this country typically run from 3 to 50 GPG.

<ul>
<li><strong>0 to 1 GPG</strong>: soft water</li>
<li><strong>1 to 3.5 GPG</strong>: slightly hard water</li>
<li><strong>3.5 to 7 GPG</strong>: moderately hard water</li>
<li><strong>7+ GPG</strong>: hard or very hard water</li>
</ul>

The water analysis you have performed will tell you the GPG figure and thus whether a softener is called for.

<h2>What size softener</h2>

After you’ve learned your water’s GPG, you need to determine your daily household water use before you can choose the right softener. To do this, multiply 75 (average daily per person gallons of water used) by the number of people in your household.

For example, a 4-person household would average 300 gals. per day. Multiplying the 300 gallons x GPG hardness of your Water (20 GPG is common in many areas), gives you a figure of 6,000 GPG total hardness per day.

Water softener capacities are given in terms of the number of grains of hardness they will remove between successive regenerations. The typical household softener’s capacity is between 20,0OO-30,000 grains. It's recommended that a softener have enough capacity to last at least three days between regenerations.

Using the example of 6,000 GPG, a 3-day capacity means 18,000 grains. Thus, a softener with a 20,000 resin bed capacity would meet your needs.

<h2>Added sodium concerns</h2>

The harder the water supply being softened, the more sodium that’s added to the water. If you’re concerned about the added sodium in your body, or if you’re already on a low sodium diet, check with your doctor before installing a water softener.

You can prevent adding sodium to your water intake by having soft water in the hot water line only. Then you’re able to drink and cook with unsoftened, cold water.

<h2>T-I-Y: Test It Yourself</h2>

There’s a test for water hardness that you can do without fancy equipment. It’s not the most sophisticated test, and you won’t get specific numbers, but you'll get an idea about the hardness of your water supply.

The test requires three items: a glass jar, with lid; some pure detergent or bar soap (Ivory soap or detergent works well); and unsoftened, cold tap water.

Fill the jar about half-full with cold, unsoftened tap water. Next, sprinkle just a few flakes of detergent, or scrape a few shavings of bar soap into the water. Place the lid securely on the jar and shake the water and detergent/soap until a lather or foam appears on top of the water.

If there’s little or no lather, the water would be considered hard. Now, dip your finger into the water. Hard water will leave soap deposits, or soap curd, on your finger and the inside of the jar. If this is your situation, you'll probably want your water hardness tested more scientifically.

<h2>Magnetize your water for softness? Don’t bet on it</h2>

Water conditioning gadgets and gimmicks appear throughout the country on a regular basis. They bring to mind the old "Cure All Elixers.” Use them, and your problems are solved.

Baloney!

The water magnet is one of these oft-promoted wonder cures. It’s attached to the hot or cold water line and claims to magnetically charge the water and lock the hardness minerals in each molecule. For best results, of course, the manufacturer recommends you buy a magnet for both hot and cold lines. Besides, they sell for $400 each!

One advertising illustration actually shows confused water molecules running helter skelter in the water line. But, after they pass through the section of pipe with the magnetizer, they come out in neat little rows, like toy soldiers.

The independent tests on these products show one thing: They don't work.

There have been numerous tests conducted to check the validity of these claims. The South Dakota School of Mines and Technology found no change in the physical and/or chemical properties of water treated with permanent magnetic devices.

Just remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Wood finishing: why does oak stain better than pine?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Everyone who's dipped a rag into a can of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_stain">stain</a> can recall the time when rubbing the color into the wood resulted in disaster. Remember? Rather than contrasting hues and lines revealing the subtle beauty of the wood, you found yourself staring at muddy tones, ugly splotches, and glaring surface flaws that made it look awful.

It's a painful reminder that some types of wood (pine, birch and maple, for example) don't take stain as easily as others (oak, ash, hickory). Each wood has its unique character, so if you want your stained pine to look like stained oak, you‘re going to be disappointed.

Yet all types of wood will take a good finish —— some are just tougher to stain than others. In this article you’ll understand why some wood takes stain poorly and what you can do about it.

<h2>What is stain?</h2>

“Stain” in a broad sense can mean anything you use to color wood, but I'll use it here to mean “pigmented” stains, because that’s what you'll most often find in a home center or paint store.

Pigmented stains are the easiest to apply. They’re actually a thin paint, consisting of a pigment, a binder, and a solvent.

The <strong>pigment</strong> is a finely ground colored powder, actually a dust that you spread over the surface of the wood to color it. It doesn't dissolve.

The <strong>binder</strong> glues the pigment to the wood.

The <strong>solvent</strong> (usually paint thinner or water) liquefies the binder and holds the pigment in suspension so you can spread it evenly. Then the solvent evaporates.

When you spread a stain, the pigment collects and builds up in every crack, crevasse and depression in the surface of the wood.

<h2>How does wood absorb stain?</h2>

Here's where the nature of the wood itself comes in. Wood consists of thousands of hollow cells (Fig. A), some large and some small. Large cells collect more pigment and go dark; smaller cells collect less and appear light. So when you spread your stain, you're actually highlighting the varying cell structure of a tree.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-finishing-tips-1-how-pine-absorbs-stain.jpg" alt="" width="776" height="848" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1392" />

<strong>Relatively large cells in the earlywood of pine absorb more stain and turn dark. Smaller latewood cells absorb less and remain lighter. Blotchy appearance is common to pine and other softwoods.</strong>

As you might guess, the cell structure of pine (Fig. A), which takes stain poorly, is quite different from oak (Fig. B), which takes stain well. Most of the cells in pine grow relatively large during the first part of each growing season. The wood made up of these large cells is called “earlywood.” It absorbs a lot of stain compared to the narrow bands of very small cells that form later in the season. called “latewood”.

Though you can‘t see either of these types of cells with your naked eye, stain will color the earlywood darker than the latewood.

ln oak, on the other hand. you can actually see one large type of earlywood cell, called a “vessel.” If you look at the smoothly cut end grain of oak (at the top end of Fig. B) you can see rows of these vessels that look like tiny pinholes to the naked eye. They absorb a lot of stain, in sharp contrast to the microscopic cells in the latewood, which absorb little. That contrast. of course. Is why dramatic “grain” lines show up in oak when it's stained.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-finishing-tips-2-how-oak-absorbs-stain.jpg" alt="" width="739" height="839" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1393" />

<strong>Narrow bands of large vessels in the earlywood of oak absorb lots of stain and become darker. Smaller vessels in the latewood absorb less and remain lighter. However, many hardwoods do not have clear bands of vessels and do not take stain easily.</strong>

<h2>Staining softwoods</h2>

All softwoods (coniferous trees like fir, spruce, cedar, etc.) have a cell structure like pine, and often look bland and lifeless when you stain them.

One reason for this is that most softwoods do not have prominent bands of latewood, so there is little pattern or grain to highlight. Two notable exceptions are Southern yellow pine and Douglas fir. Both have wider bands of latewood that can cause headaches because they contrast too much! (Douglas fir plywood displays the earlywood/latewood contrast most vividly.)

A second reason for staining difficulty is that earlywood often doesn’t absorb stain evenly. Wood cells grow like a bundle of soda straws. Where their ends show on the surface of a board (end grain), they absorb a lot of stain, but where their sides are exposed, they absorb less. Unfortunately. most of the time the wood cells don’t grow together in a perfect bundle, straight up the trunk of the tree. Sometimes they swirl, especially around knots, and emerge on the surface of a board at different angles. These areas will absorb stain differently than the surrounding cells, causing a blotchy appearance (Fig. A).

Third, softwoods stain poorly because they're soft. Their cell walls bend and crush easily as you prepare the surfaces for finishing. So scrapes, dents, and even sanding marks can suddenly appear when you apply a stain.

And fourth, stain reverses the natural contrast in softwoods. Latewood is slightly darker than earlywood, a feature that a clear finish (no pigment) can highlight. But when stained, earlywood absorbs more pigment than latewood, appears darker, and reverses its natural contrast (Fig. A). This might come as an unpleasant surprise if you don't expect it.

<h2>Staining hardwoods</h2>

Hardwoods (deciduous or broad-leaved trees) aren’t all easy to stain either, despite the fact that they all have relatively large vessel cells (Fig. B) like oak. As mentioned earlier. oak has bands of vessels in its earlywood that absorb stain readily and contrast with the latewood.

However, vessels in many other hardwoods do not occur in bands; often they spread throughout the tree's annual ring. So when they absorb stain, they don't highlight any grain pattern, just like many softwoods. Maple and birch are two common examples, they’re as hard to stain as pine.

<h2>What you can do</h2>

Just because the cells seem stacked against you when you try to stain some types of wood doesn’t mean your efforts are doomed to fail. It simply means you’ll have to prepare your wood more carefully and experiment with finishes.

Here are ways to improve your chances for success.

If possible, select wood that has good staining potential, particularly hardwoods that show clear bands of vessels and softwoods that have a clearly visible earlywood/latewood contrast. Staining will emphasize the contrast. In softwoods, you can also look for boards with narrow, relatively straight grain lines, where the darker bands of late wood are close together. These boards often stain more evenly than wood containing wide bands of earlywood.

In both hardwoods and softwoods, cells emerge differently on each side of the same board, so examine the grain lines and contrast most closely on the sides that you want to make prominent.

Because softwood surfaces are fragile, fuss over them a bit. Carefully sand out all dents and scratches, glue marks, old finish, etc., ending up by completely hand-sanding the entire surface with fine-grit (120 or finer) paper. Use the same hand pressure everywhere: pressing harder in one area can change the surface texture. (Even if you use a power sander, finish up by hand.) Take the same care with maple and birch, too. Patience and thorough work at this point will pay off in the end.

You can test your surface for flaws before you stain by rubbing it with a cloth dampened in mineral spirits. This will darken the surface just enough to show mars and sanding marks. After the surface dries in 10 to 20 minutes, sand out any flaws, then go ahead and stain.

Always stain an obscure area first, or use a test board of the same material, to see how the wood absorbs the pigment. If you don’t like it, you can always sand it off before you go too far. Fortunately, the pigments in stains don't sink far below the woods surface.

<h2>Try other techniques</h2>

If your wood still doesn't stain nicely, you have several options.

First, try applying a “sealer.” This is essentially a clear binder (paint without the pigment) that fills, or partially fills, the open wood cells. It keeps those cells from absorbing as much pigment. In effect, it reduces contrast between the light and dark areas. You can choose among many kinds of sealers, including thinned varnish, linseed oil, and commercially prepared stain retarders.

Experimentation is the watchword here, because wood varies greatly, not only among species, but among individual trees and even between different sides of the same board. For example, end grain, as we mentioned earlier, has many deep cells, which absorb a lot of stain. It will always go dark, so you might want to seal it to keep it light.

Second, on a wood scrap, try applying different concentrations of stain for lighter and deeper color. Often light-grained woods look good with a light stain, just enough to emphasize their grain lines and other patterns, but not enough to heighten the blotchy effect caused by uneven earlywood cells. In fact, a clear finish alone might do the job on maple and pine, since it will slightly darken the wood surface and bring out some patterns.

At the other extreme, a very dark stain can veil some of the blotchy effects in some types of wood. The woodworkers who stained the birch doors and trim in my home shaded the blotchy areas darker while they left areas with nice grain lines slightly lighter to emphasize them. It was an effective solution for a difficult wood.

Third, experiment with different brands of stain. Walnut stain “Brand A” won’t necessarily look the same on the wood as walnut stain “Brand B,” even though the color might look the same in the can. Manufacturers often use different pigments, binders, and solvents.

<h2>Venture into dyes</h2>

A fourth option is to abandon stains altogether and try a dye. As mentioned earlier, I'm using “stain” to refer only to pigmented stains. Unlike pigments, dye doesn't collect in voids in the wood‘s surface Instead, it penetrates and colors the woods cell walls themselves, highlighting the cell structure even more clearly.

That’s why fine furniture makers use dyes: they’re transparent and show off the patterns in wood better, of course, they also show off every irregularity and flaw, too. So until you experiment with a dye, you  won't know if it will work any better than a stain.

Look for wood dyes in specialty woodworking shops. They’re harder to apply than stains, so ask for some free advice while you're shopping. Whether they come powdered or in concentrate form, you'll have to mix and apply them to test boards until you find a pleasing color and effect.

As you experiment, you'll probably find that wood finishing is more art than science. At least that's one way to keep positive in the midst of a frustrating wood-finishing job! And knowing that beauty is at least partly in the eye of the beholder can give you a creative edge. (“Creative” solutions look better if your spouse agrees.) Who would have guessed that stained pine — knots, blotches and all — would become as fashionable and popular as it has?

Of course, in the end you might be dissatisfied with everything you try. That’s why most of us paint those hard-to-stain softwoods like pine, and put a clear finish on others like maple. Often there’s little more we can do to make them look better.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Starting woodworking can be very simple and very rewarding.

The sheer pleasure of molding wood to suit the form and function you chose, the process to make it all happen, the satisfaction of doing things yourself, and the pride you feel from accomplishing the task are all great feelings that make this hobby a great therapy for the soul.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-634" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Woodworking-1024x683.jpg" />

Buying a good tool and using it to produce furniture and doing odd jobs around the house can <a href="http://bestlife52.com/financial-independence/">help you save lots of money</a> too.

But how can you start your first steps in woodworking?
<h2>Location, Location, Location</h2>
Where are you going to set up your workshop?

A minority of woodworkers are brave apartment dwellers who have used have a spare closet, room, or even outside in their balconies. Anything is possible and it all depends on you, so get rid of obstacles and think about possible solutions to your situation.

Most people interested in woodworking, however, live in <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/">houses</a>, and most of them will probably use their basements or their garages. Not all can afford the luxury of huge empty spaces at home, but make sure you claim at least a corner for a workbench, with enough space for storing tools and supplies.
<h2>Basement, Garage, Or Backyard?</h2>
A <strong>basement</strong> can be good because it is better isolated against outside temperature changes, however air quality and lack of natural lighting, can be an issue. Air filtering and LED lighting can solve these issues. Another thing to keep in mind is the noise produced by your machinery, so remember to address that as well. Another possible issue is to bring wood inside your basement workshop and get finished projects out of your shop – depending on how accessible your shop is, this may or may not be an issue for you.

A <strong>garage</strong> brings the exact opposite scenario: the possibility of opening the doors and exchanging air easily, good lighting throughout the day, (mostly) isolated from the house and less concern about tool noise, and bringing wood in and projects out is much simpler. However, thermal isolation tends to be worse, and there is also the concern that strangers might be eyeing your tools while you are working and eventually pay a visit to your garage to steal your prized tools.

The best alternative might be a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/build-yard-shed-pictures-plans-step-by-step/"><strong>small shed in your backyard</strong></a>. Even 200 sq. ft. might be enough to ensure all the good aspect from working above ground, in a place where you ensure your privacy and protect your tools. If you are smart about how you make this addition to your property, it might even add to the eventual resale value.

No matter what type of space you choose, consider getting some anti-fatigue mats, so you can reduce worker leg and back pain.
<h2>Your Most Important Projects</h2>
Well, the best way to start woodworking is by building things to organize your own tools and your workspace – in other words, making a toolbox and a workbench.

These are two useful projects where you can practice essential skills and start learning the basics. If you make small mistakes, they will not be seen by others and your final projects will still be useful and lasting.
<h3>Your First Toolbox</h3>
Each toolbox is personal and completely different because each one of us has different needs. Your uses and imagination are the only boundaries here!

Depending on how many tools you have, and how handy you are, you may want to make a simple first toolbox or themed toolboxes according to the tools you place inside – for example, a toolbox for measuring and cutting tools, another for your cordless drill plus all your drilling and driving bits, a third for sanding paper and finishing supplies, and even another one for carrying all the general use tools for DIY jobs around the house.

Here are some plans for a <a href="http://www.handymanwire.com/articles/toolbox.html">simple toolbox</a>. The tools you will need are:
<ul>
 	<li>tape measure to measure all your cuts;</li>
 	<li>a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-circular-saw/">circular saw</a> to cut the plywood;</li>
 	<li>a hammer, some 6d finish nails, and wood glue, for the joinery;</li>
 	<li>a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/best-cordless-drill/">power drill</a> with a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/best-drill-bit-set/">Forstner bit</a> to drill the handle holes; and</li>
 	<li><a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/eye-protection/">safety glasses</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Your First Workbench</h3>
As for a workbench, in my opinion, a good beginner workbench has to offer some storage space as well, this way you can have all your tools and supplies on hand when starting a project instead of searching around the entire house for the glue, and the nails, and the pliers, and so on.

I personally like to have the tools displayed in front of me, and I do not want to attach things to my walls, so that leaves me with a freestanding bench with a tool board. You might even wish to hang a computer monitor there, so you can display PDF plans or review some YouTube tutorials while you are in your shop.

Going back to a more traditional approach to your “tool” board, when a tool has an easy place to be returned to, you increase your odds of keeping your workspace tidy – most of the times, at least. Efficiency will free your mind and open space for your creativity. The path from one to the other is what will keep you busy for countless hours without even realizing time passed by.

If you want to build this <a href="https://www.familyhandyman.com/workshop/workbench/how-to-build-a-workbench-super-simple-50-bench/view-all/">workbench with tool storage</a>, these are the tools you will need:
<ul>
 	<li>tape measure to measure all your cuts;</li>
 	<li>a circular saw to cut the plywood and the 2x4s;</li>
 	<li>a power drill with a pilot hole and countersink bit to pre-drill the holes and a drive bit to drive all the screws; and</li>
 	<li>safety glasses.</li>
</ul>
As for size, workspace surface has to be proportional to the types of projects you want to build. Personally, I am just interested in smaller projects such as picture frames, desktop objects, boxes, and so on. If you want to build cabinetry and furniture, that will certainly influence the workbench size you need.

And remember: you can always graduate to a more traditional workbench later and leave this one for keeping your tool board and other benchtop tools such as a drill press, a grinder, or even a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/benchtop-jointer/">small jointer</a>.

In case you don’t need the storage space, then you are better off building a <a href="http://woodgears.ca/workbench/build.html">simpler workbench</a> – the plans I just linked use less wood and better joinery. You can also watch the construction:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jlPo9p0lzPw?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Use personal protective equipment. There are many models of <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/eye-protection/">safety glasses</a> available and you are bound to find something good and inexpensive, which will protect your eyesight from eventual accidents. <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/hearing-protection/">Hearing protection</a> is also essential if you are operating power tools – saws, grinders, drills, anything. Wear a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/respirators/">dust mask</a> over your nose and mouth to avoid breathing particles of whatever material you are working with. The US Department of Labor has a <a href="https://www.osha.gov/Publications/woodworking_hazards/osha3157.html">good starting guide on woodworking hazards</a>.

Use properly sharpened tools. A dull tool is the first step to you over-applying force in some random way you weren’t meant to. Then the tool will escape your control and fall. It could be just a broken tool, which you can solve with cash and some online shopping, or the tool could fall on you and break/cut/shock you, and you could end up in the hospital for something completely avoidable.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Random-orbit sanders combine the aggressiveness of belt sanders with the accuracy of hand sanding.

Belt sanders may work the fastest, finishing sanders may work the smoothest, and hand sanding may be the most accurate — but random-orbit sanders do a darn good job on all three fronts.
<h2>How To Choose A Random-Orbit Sander</h2>
If you are planning on buying a small sander, you might be interested in knowing the difference between orbital sanders and random-orbit sanders. Are they any good?

<strong>Compared to traditional orbital sanders, random-orbit sanders sand quicker, leave fewer swirl marks (those ugly pigtail-shaped scratches), can use coarser grits for rapid stock removal, and offer optional dust control devices. They also offer the convenience of self-stick sandpaper.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1808" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/random-orbit-sander.jpg" alt="" width="662" height="627" />

Most major tool manufacturers make random-orbit sanders. Some are powerful, two-handed tools that resemble a body grinder; others are lighter weight and better for close quarters and ﬁnish work. Take your pick. I strongly recommend, however, that you choose a sander with some form of a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/small-woodshop-dust-collection/">dust collector</a>.

The sandpaper discs can be adhesive-backed or attached with a Velcro hook-and-loop system. Adhesive-backed paper is less expensive and more readily available. while the hook-and-loop is more convenient and much longer-lasting.

Hook-and-loop is the best choice for users who switch grits a lot on small projects because the pads can be removed and reused repeatedly.

<a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/new-hobby-woodworking/">Woodworkers</a>, carpenters, and <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/">do-it-yourselfers</a> who’ve tried them would sooner give up their work boots than part with their random-orbit sander.

These sanders, in pneumatic (air powered) form, have actually been around a long time in the automotive industry. Known as “dual action” sanders, they're used by body shops for paint preparation and finish-sanding.

The electric models, designed for portability with the woodworker and DIYer in mind, have taken the tool market by storm. Here’s why.
<h2>Why Should I Buy A Random-Orbit Sander?</h2>
At first glance, these tools may remind you of an ordinary disc sander — but that’s where the similarity ends.

Random-orbit sanders combine a spinning motion with a secondary orbital motion (Photo 1) made possible by an offset counterbalance. When you apply pressure, the sanding pad moves around the work area much the same as a random circular hand movement, only much faster.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1809" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/random-orbit-sander-1-grip-sander-firmly.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="428" />

<strong>Grip the sander firmly (or the random motion will decide your path for you). This pistol-grip model has enough power to smooth a rough-sewn cedar board.</strong>

You can sand many times faster with the random-orbit sander than with conventional vibrating or orbital finish sanders. The random “jitterbug” movement of the pad and disc ensures an unrepeated path for the sandpaper.

The end result is a swirl-free finish — even on joints where wood grain meets perpendicularly (Photo 2).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1810" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/random-orbit-sander-2-sanding-opposing-grain.jpg" alt="" width="626" height="437" />

<strong>Sanding opposing grain without leaving swirl marks is this sender’s real forte. You can even use coarser grits without leaving deep scratch marks.</strong>
<h2>How Do I Use A Random-Orbit Sander?</h2>
Using these tools for the first time is like dancing with a new partner.

The random motion has a tendency to lead, so take control and you’ll get along just fine.
<ul>
 	<li>Before tackling a real project, practice on some scrap material.</li>
 	<li>Place the sander flat on your workpiece before you turn on the switch. Otherwise, you may catch the sanding disc on the edge of your work and tear it — or worse yet, gouge the work surface of a veneer or softwood such as pine.</li>
 	<li>To keep small workpieces from sliding while sanding, place foam carpet pad or a router pad under them, or use a clamp.</li>
 	<li>Wear <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/eye-protection/">safety glasses</a>, <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/hearing-protection/">hearing protection</a>, and a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/respirators/">respirator or dust mask</a> whenever you use your sander.</li>
 	<li>Keep the cord away from the action or you could end up nipping or breaking it.</li>
 	<li>If the pad that holds the sandpaper becomes damaged, replace it or the finely tuned balance of the counterweight will be disturbed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tips For Sanding With A Random-Orbit Sander</h2>
The list of uses is nearly endless, but here are some areas where random-orbit sanders really stand out:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>On cabinet doors and face frames</strong> (Photo 2) where boards meet at right angles to one another. Random-orbit sanders smooth the joint without leaving swirl marks across the grains of the wood.</li>
 	<li><strong>On tabletops, cutting boards, and other flat surfaces</strong>. Worked in an arcing motion, they sand quickly and smoothly. Be careful on plywood and veneer tops; you can sand right through the thin wood skin.</li>
 	<li><strong>For <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/painting-furniture/">refinishing</a> and painting preparation</strong>. The sander cuts quickly through old paint or the residue left by chemical strippers. Before repainting, improve the bond of your new paint by sanding and lightly roughening the surface (use a fine, 220-grit sandpaper for this task). Random-orbit sanders will also remove paint quickly from metal surfaces that need preparation for priming and repainting. Latex paints can gum up the sanding discs; oil paints are much easier to remove. Remember, sanding lead-based paint can be hazardous to your health; use one of the test kits on the market to see if the paint contains lead.</li>
 	<li><strong>For buffing a faded paint job</strong> or unpainted brass and copper (Photo 3). Use a buffing attachment and special polishing compounds as needed.</li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1811" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/random-orbit-sander-3-buff-car-finish.jpg" alt="" width="553" height="389" />

<strong>Buff your car’s finish after waxing. Use at low RPM only, and be careful around style lines and dyes. Too much heat could wear away the paint. </strong>
<h2>What Is The Best Random-Orbit Sander?</h2>
Random-orbit sanders fall into three broad categories:
<h3>Right Angle Sanders</h3>
Right angle sanders (opening photo) are the most aggressive. Their powerful motors make them ideal for heavy-duty uses like sanding large surfaces, tabletops, wood and fiberglass boats. and auto body panels.

Their resemblance to angle grinders is not just coincidental. In fact, if you have a 4-1/2 in. or 5-in. angle grinder, an accessory attachment is available to turn your grinder into a random-orbit sander.

The right angle sander is available in 5- or 6-in. diameter pad styles, as well as in single or variable speeds.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1817" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Random-Orbit-Sander-Right-Angle-Porter-Cable-7346SP.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="249" />
<p class="box">The Porter-Cable 7346SP has a 6-inch pad and can be adjusted between electronically with a speed dial between 2,500 and 6,800 OPM. You can buy it with an optional lamb wool polishing pad, so you can use it when woodworking and taking care of your car, too. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M64AQYI/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Click here to read Amazon customer reviews and buy it now.</a></p>

<h3>Pistol Grip Sanders</h3>
Pistol grip sanders (Photo 1) are often equipped with a “D”-shaped handle that helps you control the tool.

These tools are less powerful and aggressive than their right angle cousins but are much easier to control. They're the most versatile of all the orbitals. I use mine for everything from smoothing rough-sawn boards to fine sanding furniture

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1816" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Random-Orbit-Sander-Pistol-Grip-Makita-BO541K.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="284" />
<p class="box">The pistol grip with trigger switch in the Makita BO5041K, plus the second hand grip, both allow for more comfort when sanding. It’s also lightweight, meaning less stress on shoulders and arms. This is a great choice and it’ll last you very, very long. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003M5IWM8/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Click here to buy it from Amazon.</a></p>

<h3>(Battery-Powered) Palm Grip Sanders</h3>
Palm grip sanders (Photo 6) are best suited for light-duty sanding such as finish-sanding furniture and cabinetry. Don’t expect to sand a stack of rough-sawn beams with this type.

But they have excellent control and can be used with one hand for hard-to-reach spots.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1815" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Random-Orbit-Sander-Palm-Grip-Makita-XOB01Z.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="431" />
<p class="box">Many tool manufacturers are releasing cordless versions of palm grip random-orbit sanders, meaning you can choose between the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M9CXMNY/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Makita XOB01Z</a> (pictured above), the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017POA9R2/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Ryobi P411</a>, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07456PWNL/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Black &amp; Decker BDCRO20C</a>, or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017ODPO5Q/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Ridgid R8606B</a> based on which battery system you already use. Super convenient! All links point to the respective Amazon product pages.</p>

<h2>Sandpaper Types And Dust Collection</h2>
Sanding discs are secured to the sander by either a hook-and-loop system (Photo 4), or with a pressure sensitive adhesive (Photo 5). These special papers are expensive but they're the key to the success of these tools. Quick paper changes are a real advantage with those sanders.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1812" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/random-orbit-sander-4-hook-and-loop-style-pad-and-disc.jpg" alt="" width="559" height="426" />

<strong>Apply and remove pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) discs, working from one edge of the pad. Remove PSA discs right after use or they become bears to get off.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1813" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/random-orbit-sander-5-pressure-sensitive-adhesive-disc.jpg" alt="" width="529" height="426" />

<strong>Hook-and-loop pads and discs allow you to change and reuse paper more easily. The pad has tiny hooks that grab onto fuzzy-backed discs.</strong>

Random-orbit sanders really kick up the dust, so do yourself a favor and get one with some type of dust collection system (Photo 6).

These have built-in exhaust fans that stick dust through holes in the disc and pad and then deposit it in a bag canister or a shop vacuum.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1814" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/random-orbit-sander-6-dust-collection-accessories.jpg" alt="" width="804" height="628" />

<strong>Keep the dust to a minimum with dust collection accessories. The small diameter vacuum hose connects to your shop vacuum for greater <a href=" http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/small-woodshop-dust-collection/">dust control</a>. The canister stays out of the way and is easily removed and emptied. Bags are available on other models.</strong>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Carpentry and woodworking are just not throw-together affairs. That can become joyfully apparent at the great moment of truth when you step back to look at your finished job and everything fits. And the square — in all its variations — is one of the tools that will get you to this moment of truth.

<h2>Six Tips for Three Squares</h2>

<strong>The carpenter’s square usually has a 16-in. longue and 24-in. blade, though some are smaller. The large size provides accuracy for framing or squaring large objects.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/3-basic-squares-0-tongue-blade.jpg" alt="" width="636" height="536" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1398" />

<strong>Make 45-degree angles with a carpenter’s square by setting the same number: along the board’s edge. Stair gauges are for repetitive cuts.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/3-basic-squares-1-carpenters.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="363" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1404" />

<strong>The combination square has a sliding blade and gives both 90- and 45-degree readings. The tongue contains a small level and the thumbscrew for locking the blade.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/3-basic-squares-2-combination.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="364" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1399" />

<strong>Mark a board for ripping by setting the blade to the desired measurement, then pull the square and the pencil together along the edge of the board.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/3-basic-squares-3-mark-a-board.jpg" alt="" width="416" height="395" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1400" />

<strong>Measure the depth of a cut or a fitting by sliding the blade end to the bottom of the cut, locking the thumbscrew and taking your reading.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/3-basic-squares-4-measure-depth.jpg" alt="" width="539" height="422" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1401" />

<strong>A Speed square has a tongue lip you can hold tight against the edge of the board, then run the circular saw base along the arm of the square. No need to mark a line.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/3-basic-squares-5-speed.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="398" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1402" />

<strong>Compute any angle with a Speed square; hold the pivot point against the board edge and rotate the square to the desired angle, shown on the diagonal arm. </strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/3-basic-squares-6-compute-any-angle.jpg" alt="" width="419" height="398" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1403" />

<h2>Go beyond measuring 90 degrees</h2>

There's nothing really mysterious about squares. Yet, even the simplest square among all the variations does a lot more than just make a straight, right-angle line.

You’ll learn how to make squares do their best work for you, and how to use the three main types:

<ul>
<li>the carpenter's square,</li>
<li>the combination square, and</li>
<li>the Speed square.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Working square</h2>

Every square has two basic parts:

<ul>
<li>The “<strong>tongue</strong>,” usually the shorter arm, goes against the edge of the board or the piece you want to mark. </li>
<li>The “<strong>blade</strong>” is the arm against which you mark your line.</li>
</ul>

Some squares — the combination square, shown in Photo 3, for example, — have a double tongue, one for 90 degrees and the other for 45 degrees.

No matter what. your square has to be square. If it's not. throw it away and buy a new one. Here’s how to test it:

<ol>
<li>Hold the tongue tight against the straight edge of a board and mark a fine line along the blade.</li>
<li>Flip the square over and with the tongue against the same edge of the board, mark a second line over the first.</li>
<li>If the lines don't match, your square is no good.</li>
</ol>

Even if the square is off just a little, keep in mind that over longer distances — for example if you’re using a framing square to position deck joists — a small inaccuracy can add up to a lot at the far end.

Here are some other tips for squaring and marking accurately:

<ul>
<li>Hold the tongue firmly against the edge of the piece you're marking, and make sure this edge is not irregular or bowed. Don't trust your lumber edge to be straight: sight along the edge first. And incidentally, don’t trust the precut ends of lumber or plywood to be square either, check them out.</li>
<li>Keep the blade of the square flat on the surface of the board you’re marking. If the blade is raised at one end, your pencil mark will probably not be accurate.</li>
<li>Make your pencil line just dark enough to see it when you cut. If you bear down too hard on the pencil, the line you’re marking will thicken as the point wears down, and it will be inaccurate. Holding the pencil at about 60 degrees, as shown in Photo 2, also helps for line accuracy.</li>
<li>After marking a line, double-check it with the tongue against the opposite edge of the board.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The time-honored carpenter’s square</h2>

The carpenter‘s square goes by other names as well: framing square, steel square, rafter square or flat square. It has been around in some form or other since the pyramids were built. It usually has a 16-in. tongue and a 24-in. blade, and this large size makes it highly accurate for laying out and squaring large patterns or pieces.

It’s especially useful for laying out deck framing, installing door and window frames, and placing joists and rafters. But it excels at simpler jobs as well — marking a door bottom for trimming, squaring cabinets, and cabinet parts, cutting large plywood sheets, laying tile, or simply as a long straight-edge for cutting glass, insulation. Shingles, or wallboard with a utility knife.

Both the tongue and blade of a carpenter's square have incremental inch marks on both sides of both edges. These inch markings are useful for straight-line measuring, but they're also valuable for making angle cuts or cutouts. Placing the same inch mark of each arm along the edge of a board will give you a 45-degree angle, as shown in Photo 1. The screw-on stair gauges shown allow you to preset any angle and make the same repetitive marks for cutting stair risers, rafters or decking.

Some carpenter’s squares come with root rafter framing tables stamped on the blade — used for determining rafter lengths and angles — along with very complicated instructions on how to use these tables.

You can expect to spend about $20 for a good-quality carpenter’s square.

<h2>The versatile combination square</h2>

A combination square is designed to give you a quick 90- or 45-degree angle. But its easy-sliding blade, which locks in place with a thumbscrew, gives this square lots of other uses besides.

Reach for it whenever you need to mark a long, straight line along the length of a board, parallel to the edges. Just set the measurement you want using the inch markings on the blade. Then draw the square along the edge of a board, as shown in Photo 3. Of course, your board edge needs to be straight for the line to come out straight.

Combination squares are great for measuring the depth of a saw cut or other recess in a flat surface. You can get an easier and more accurate reading than you’ll usually get with a tape rule.

The combination square's 12-in. steel blade can slide all the way out of its slot and you can use it as a straightedge for marking or for cutting with a utility knife.

The spirit level, set between the tongues, has limited accuracy because of its small size, but it’s quick and easy to use and always readily at hand, since the square is small enough to carry in most belt pouches.

A good combination square costs around $15.

<h2>The quick and handy Speed square</h2>

The Speed square is a recent invention. It's called other things — triangle square, quick square — but Speed square is the name given to it by Swanson, the company that first made it, and it’s what most carpenters call it. You'll find one in just about every carpenters pouch.

Not only does the Speed square give you a quick 90- or 45-degree angle, but the tongue lip allows you to hold the square securely in place against the edge of the board so you can use the square itself to run the base of a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-circular-saw/">circular saw</a> along (Photo 5): no need to even mark the board. Most Speed squares are made of material that's lightweight, yet thick enough to guide the saw base.

The Speed square is also a quick and nifty angle finder. Photo 6 shows how the end at the tongue lip serves as the pivot point for finding and marking an angle. The angle readings are stamped on the diagonal arm of the triangle, and you draw your line along the vertical arm.

You can also buy a variation of the Speed square (not shown), which has a pivoting tongue guide that locks in place with a thumbscrew.

This allows you to make angle cuts using the square as a guide for the saw base, just as you would for 90-degree cuts.

Speed squares are made of steel or lighter metal, as well as plastic. They come in various sizes up to 12.in., and range in cost from $5 to $20.

<h2>Square care</h2>

Squares are precision tools; they should be treated with kindness. A carpenter’s square will be anything but if it‘s dropped from more than a few feet, and if either arm is bent, you‘ll get inaccurate readings. Combination squares are the most delicate, and shouldn’t be dropped or banged around. Speed squares are the toughest of the three, and can stand up to an occasional tumble. Just don’t use it to open paint cans.

Oil your squares occasionally with any light machine oil to prevent rusting, and apply oil to the moving parts of a combination square.

If the stamped markings on a metal square become worn and hard to read, you can make them visible again. Just wipe over them with a cloth dipped in either white or black paint. depending on the squares color. Then lightly wipe the paint from the surface.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here’s a handbook that outlines the best ways to build a high-quality elevated deck. Keep it at your side as you plan, design, and complete your own.

<h2>Basic steps for building a raised deck (the TL;DR version)</h2>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Foundation</strong>. Dig the holes for your posts - make sure to go beyond the frost line.</li>
	<li><strong>Pour concrete</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Ledger</strong>. Install the ledger first, and slip proper flashing to stop rot.</li>
	<li>Place <strong>steel connectors</strong> - the strongest way to attach posts to concrete.</li>
	<li><strong>Cut posts</strong> using your ledger as a height reference.</li>
	<li>Set the beam on top of your posts and <strong>check beam alignment</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Attach joists</strong> using galvanized joist hanger (truss) nails.</li>
	<li>Bolt rail posts to joists and <strong>build your guardrail</strong>. Make sure it feels safe, and not just "safe enough".</li>
	<li><strong>Lay decking</strong>, bark side up for improved drainage.</li>
	<li><strong>Enjoy your new deck</strong> with family and friends!</li>
	<li>(Optional) <strong>Add clear penetrating sealer or exterior stain</strong> every couple of years for protection against water and increased durability.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The finer details</h2>

Everyone knows how pleasant a deck can be, but as the builder, you get an additional reward — the pleasure of knowing you've made a first-class addition to your home. You will sense it every time you step out on your deck listen. Your footsteps on the deck boards sound crisp and firm, like the floor in your house. Its structure remains rigid and doesn’t sway as kids run across it. The guardrail feels firm, too. so you can lean against it confidently. And year after year it serves you well, virtually maintenance-free, a good investment for your home.

Fortunately, the path from the deck of your imagination to a real one isn’t hard, because there’s nothing complicated about building a quality deck. Like a childhood Erector set, its exposed structure reveals how all the pieces fit together, from the bottom up.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/deck-building-330x1024.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1408" />

Keeping an eye on that structure, you will understand the entire deck-building process. At each step you’ll learn deck-building fundamentals and several alternative techniques you can use to make it first class. By the end you'll be able to design, plan and construct your own deck like a pro.

<h2>Building a solid foundation</h2>

As you know, decks are versatile; you can put them almost anywhere and build them almost any way you want. However, starting with a good foundation will prepare your deck for years of hard use. In fact, in most regions the local building inspector will insist on this, and a few other structural guide lines, too. Don't panic here; your building inspector's job is to make sure you build a solid, safe deck.

The foundation shoulders all the weight of the deck and people on it, so it should be strong. Usually 4x4 posts spaced every 6 in. provide enough support when they rest on a good base.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/deck-building-1-foundation.jpg" alt="" width="536" height="595" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1409" />

<strong>The foundation securely anchors the deck posts and rests on solid ground below the frost line.</strong>

Examine the foundation details in Fig. 1, and some alternative styles in Fig. 2. Notice that the bottom 6-in. section of concrete, called the “footing,” must rest on undisturbed soil (disturbed soil compresses too easily), have a flat bottom to transfer weight evenly, and be completely below your local frost line.

That’s to keep it from sinking or lilting and throwing your deck askew. Your building inspector will tell you how deep frost extends in your area. Sink foundation holes using a posthole digger or an 8-in. power auger if you have to dig a lot of them. Widen and flatten the bottoms to get a wide support base.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/deck-building-2-footings-anchors-1024x413.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="225" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1410" />

<strong>A good footing is wider at the bottom and narrower at the top to avoid frost heaves, and extends 6 in. above the ground to drain off water. Example A fails on both counts, but C and D are good. Example B is acceptable, but will rot sooner than the others. The wood/concrete connections are good in A, C and D.</strong>

Before you mix and pour the concrete, decide how you want to attach the posts to it. Figs. 1 and 2 show five examples.

Generally, steel connectors, available from lumberyards and home centers, are the strongest. They, like the wood posts themselves, should be set at least 6 in. above the ground to help them dry off faster after rain. Continual moisture from ground contact rusts steel and rots wood posts faster, so avoid that situation if you can. In addition, for posts use rot-resistant wood like pressure-treated (a .40-lb. or, even better, a .60-lb. rating), or the heartwood of redwood or cedar.

Although it’s acceptable, setting the posts directly into the ground (Fig. 2B) like fence posts invites eventual rot. They're also much harder to replace should rot occur.

Notice the two weaknesses in Fig. 2A that make this detail unacceptable:

<ol>
<li>First, the metal connector is a good one, but it won’t last long because water can easily puddle around it and rust it. The concrete should extend 6 in. higher so water will run off.</li>
<li>Second, the concrete foundation widens toward the top, inviting frost to catch its sides and heave it upward. Good footing holes have vertical sides or slope inward toward the top.</li>
</ol>

Should you mix your own concrete or buy ready-mixed from a truck? Calculate the volume needed, and compare the prices.

Then ask yourself these questions:

<ul>
<li>Is the site directly accessible to the truck?</li>
<li>How far will you have to wheelbarrow the load?</li>
<li>How long will it take? (Concrete dealers limit their offload time and charge beyond that limit.)</li>
</ul>

Then consider how long it will take to mix your own.

Normally, if you need 1 cubic yard or more, it’s easier and faster to buy ready-mixed concrete, and invite (or bribe!) some neighbors to help you dump it quickly.

<h2>Erecting posts and beams</h2>

Once the concrete hardens, you're ready to build.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/deck-building-3-support-structure.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="505" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1411" />

<strong>Posts, beams, ledgers, and joists support the deck’s weight. Make them strong and fasten them securely.</strong>

Think of your deck as a rigid platform set across two or more very strong parallel beams. You can see one of those beams in Fig. 3 from two 2x10s spiked together with 16d galvanized nails. It sits atop the 4x4 posts.

The other beam, called a “ledger,” is bolted to the rim joist (or wall studs) of the house.

<h3>The ledger</h3>

Install the ledger first, especially if you have a door opening onto the deck. In that case. make the finished deck 1/2 in. lower than the door's sill, so you won’t have an awkward step as you go out the door.

After finding the ledger height, remove the siding to about 1 in. above that point (you may have to cut it with your power saw) so you can screw the ledger tightly against the sheathing and house frame (Fig. 3).

Then slip aluminum flashing up under the siding and against the sheathing later you’ll bend the flashing over the top of the ledger to keep water from collecting against the house and causing rot.

Next, tack the ledger in place temporarily with 16d nails, then level and lag bolt it permanently, spacing the bolts about every 16 in. Use 3/8-in. bolts 3-1/2 in. long to completely penetrate the rim joist. Predrill the screw holes and use longer bolts if necessary.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/deck-building-4-ledger-to-concrete.jpg" alt="" width="348" height="645" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1412" />

<strong>Use support blocks to reinforce the ends of a ledger board when bolting it to concrete. Proper flashing stops rot.</strong>

On occasion you may need to bolt the ledger to a concrete foundation (Fig. 4). Predrill your holes for lead lag shields or expansion bolts with a hammer drill and <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/best-drill-bit-set/">special carbide drilling bit</a> to make this job easy.

For additional support, bolt blocks under both ends. Not so easy, but no less important, is to cut a groove for the flashing. Snap a chalk line and cut the 1/4-in. deep groove with a corundum (not carbide) blade on your <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-circular-saw/">circular saw</a>. Wear goggles to protect your eyes, a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/respirators/">dust mask</a>, and gloves.

<h3>Posts and beams</h3>

With your ledger in place, you can use it as a height reference for the other beam. Cut the 4x4 posts to length, fasten them to their concrete foundations, plumb them with a level and temporarily brace them in place with boards.

Then set the beam on top and nail it. (<strong>If you're working more than a few feet off the ground, lifting a heavy beam can be dangerous. Ask another person to help lift and hold it in place</strong>.) The metal post/beam cap shown in Fig. 3 is strongest, along with the one shown in Fig. 5A. Both spread the deck weight over the entire end of the post, and so stress the wood fibers least. The connections in Fig. 5B and 5C are okay, but will weaken sooner.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/deck-building-5-post-beam-connections.jpg" alt="" width="755" height="439" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1413" />

<strong>A named steel cap (A) is strongest. Examples B and C are okay, but their smaller bearing area mean more strain on the wood fibers.</strong>

Figs. 5B and 5C also show two kinds of bolts —— smooth-head carriage bolts and hexagonal-head machine bolts. Both should be galvanized. Carriage bolts look neater when the head must be visible, but at times they slip while tightening, so you can't draw them up firmly. In such cases use machine bolts, because you can steady their heads with a wrench.

Decks often fail because their beams aren‘t strong enough. Undersized beams also make a deck feel soft underfoot and bounce rather than remaining rigid.

To correctly size a beam, consider these three factors:

<ul>
<li>the weight or load it must carry,</li>
<li>its span (distance between posts), and</li>
<li>its wood type (tree species).</li>
</ul>

For most decks. two 2x10s nailed together will be strong enough if you support them with posts every 6 ft. <strong>But always ask your building inspector to confirm your design in advance</strong>.

From experience, I never hesitate to increase the strength of deck beams by one lumber size, unless it makes the design look bad. The extra strength not only adds a greater safety margin and longevity, it also makes the deck feel more solid.

<p class="note">UPDATE: I added a span table below referencing minimum beam sizes in the section Avoid Common Deck-Building Mistakes.</p>

Except for very low decks, it’s a good idea to stiffen your posts and beams with diagonal braces to prevent deck swaying (Fig. 9 below). Make sure your posts are perfectly vertical with a level, then bolt on 2x4 or 2x6 braces between the posts and beams at a 45-degree angle. The triangle created by the beam, post, and brace keeps the structure rigid.

<h2>Assembling joists and decking</h2>

You’ve completed the main structural work. Now add the platform.

First, nail on the joists. Where they butt directly into a beam or ledger, fasten them with metal joist hangers, and where they rest on top of the beam, toenail them with three 16d galvanized nails (Fig. 3).

Be sure to buy the proper size joist hangers and nail through all the holes with galvanized joist hanger nails (sometimes called galvanized truss nails). Cap the ends of the joists with a band joist (Fig. 6), nailing it securely to each joist with galvanized 16d nails, three nails per 2x6, four per 2x8, five per 2x10, etc.

As with beams, joist size depends on the weight to be supported, the length the joists have to span and their wood type. <strong>Again, always confirm your joist size with your building inspector</strong>.

As a rule of thumb. If you space joists 16 in. on center (from the center of one to the center of the next. or o.c.), a 2x6 spans 8 ft. a 2x8 spans 10 ft., and a 2x10 spans 12 ft.

But your deck will feel more solid if you limit your joist span to 8 ft. Remember, you can always add another beam to support the joists mid-span if you need to.

Before adding the deck boards, set the posts for your guardrail. Strength and safety are first priority here. So attach the posts securely to the joists with bolts (Fig. 6). One big advantage of bolts over nails here is that you can easily retighten them should they loosen.

If your 4x4 deck support posts extend above the beams (as in Figs 5B and 5C). you can use them for rail posts.

Don't skimp in your rail design. Answer the following questions:

<ul>
<li>Did you bolt your rail posts to the joists or beam?</li>
<li>Are the posts at least 2x6s or stronger?</li>
<li>Are there enough of them, at least one every 6 ft.?</li>
<li>Do they feel solidly connected to the framework when you push on them?</li>
<li>Do they have your confidence?</li>
</ul>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/deck-building-6-guardrails.jpg" alt="" width="542" height="697" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1414" />

<strong> Bolt rail posts to joists. The 2x8 block behind the post adds strength. Use 2x4s or larger lumber for guardrail. The maximum permitted opening in the guardrail varies from 4 in. to 6 in. from region to region.</strong>

Some guardrail post designs might fail some of these tests and still meet technical requirements. But they won‘t feel safe. Confidence is the key. Your deck will not feel right until you’re sure your railing is strong.

Finally. your deck nears completion. It's time to lay the decking. Nail the first board alongside, but not touching, the house, driving two 16d galvanized nails at each joist. Fig. 7 shows proper nailing technique and several types of decking. All work well.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/deck-building-7-styles.jpg" alt="" width="362" height="362" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1415" />

<strong>Lay the three common decking boards — 2x6, 2x4 and 5/4x6 — bark side up for better drainage. Drive nails 3/4 in. from board edge.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/deck-building-8-rail-post-joint.jpg" alt="" width="361" height="477" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1416" />

<strong>Cut guardrail accurately, then nail and screw it to the post. Predrill holes to mid splitting ends.</strong>

<p class="alert"><img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/deck-board-spacer-1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="413" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1423" /><br><strong>Deck Board Spacer</strong>: It's easy to space deck boards evenly. Just insert 3/8-in. wooden dowels, or the diameter of the spacing you desire, into several scrap 2x4 pieces. Place the dowels between adjacent deck boards and fasten the boards in place.</p>

Here are some other decking tips:

<ul>
<li>Space each board with a 16d nail.</li>
<li>Nail the ends of bowed boards first, forcing the bow against the previous row. Then drive a wide wooden shim between the rows to properly space the bowed board.</li>
<li>Make clean joints by cutting boards off perfectly square and butting them together over the center of a joist.</li>
<li>Predrill nail holes near board ends to avoid splitting, Make these slightly smaller than the diameter of the nail passing through them.</li>
<li>Let the boards extend beyond the edge of the deck. You can cut them all off evenly after nailing them all down.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Install the railing</h2>

Design your railing so it’s at least 36 in. high and so that a 6-in. ball (soon to be 4-in. in some regions) cannot pass through any opening (Fig. 6). The top rail should be the strongest, a 2x4 at minimum. It’s also most visible, so select your best-looking material for it.

Rails that pass over the tops of the posts are strongest and easiest to fasten. Simply nail them into the posts with 16d galvanized box nails. Other designs, like the one in Fig. 8, require careful nailing to ensure strength. Predrill both the nail and screw holes. Use 10d galvanized casing nails on the edges of the 2x4 and 2-in. No. 10 galvanized screws beneath, as shown. If your design calls for a bottom rail, make sure it is at least 2x4. All other material should be at least 2x2 or stronger.

There are many other additions you can make to your deck: benches, planters, a stairway. Let your imagination run.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/deck-building-9-completed-project.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="619" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1417" />

<strong>A well-built deck: an attractive, permanent addition to your home.</strong>

<h2>Miscellaneous tips for getting started:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Pull out a pad of paper and a pencil, and sketch the deck you'd like to add to your home. You don't have to be an artist. Just jot those ideas down.</li>
<li>Fill out the details, using other decks for examples. Chock magazines and books for ideas.</li>
<li>Go out to your proposed deck site and with a tape measure, figure out the rough dimensions: length, width, height. Note any unusual features and potential problems. Add your measurements to a more detailed sketch.</li>
<li> Take your design to your local building inspector’s office. They’ll review your plan, help size beams and joists, check the railing and generally be a good source of technical information. Go ahead and discuss your ideas in detail. They, too, are interested in your building a high-quality, safe dock. They’ll tell you if you need a permit.</li>
<li>Review your plan and draw up a material list. Count every board and bolt. 0n custom projects even the professionals do this.</li>
<li> With materials list and plan in hand, visit your favorite lumberyard to get an estimate for the cost of materials. The yard personnel can be very helpful. Respect their time. Avoid Saturdays, when they're likely to be most busy. Explain your plan, listen for new ideas and techniques, and go out into the yard and chock the wood.<br>Avoid lumber that appears wet. It will shrink excessively and might twist and warp as it dries. Good material is dry, straight and free from splits and cracks. Compare the different kinds of deck boards and railing material. Does it meet your expectations? Check several lumberyards, since quality varies.<br>Finally, price all your material and add it up. Check for extra expenses like delivery fees. Then, well, why not... ask for a discount!</li>
<li>When the lumber comes, you're ready to go. Lay out the post and foundation locations. This can be tricky, especially on sloped sites. And it needs to be accurate. So if you aren’t fully confident, look at several deck-building books. Most contain a section on layout; or ask someone who understands layout principles to help you check your work.</li>
<li>Finally, give yourself plenty of time to complete the dock. Typically, projects take longer than you first imagine, but the quality you achieve is worth it.</li>
</ol>

<h2>UPDATE: Avoid Common Deck-Building Mistakes<h2>

One of the pleasures of building a good, solid deck is believing that it'll last forever. Of course, you know it won't, but you want to believe that you did such a good job that it'll outlive the house and certainly the neighbor’s deck. And it might if you put it together right.

But despite your skills and patience, three enemies eagerly wait to reduce your new deck to a pile of waste wood in just a few years:

<ul>
<li>A weak design can cause it to collapse;</li>
<li>Rot can steadily erode its strength; and</li>
<li>Harsh weathering can crack the wood and weaken its joints.</li>
</ul>

You’ll learn how these foes attack your deck and also how to keep them at bay.

When you dive into your next deck project, plan to stop these enemies right from the start, and you’ll keep your deck healthy for a long, long time.

<h2>Design it right</h2>

Building inspectors have found that many homeowners, designing by “rules of thumb,” make beams too small. A “beam” is usually the biggest chunk of wood that lies horizontally like a spine under or at the ends of the rib-like spacing row. You can choose from either of the two beam sizes shown there, either three 2x8s or two 2x10s nailed together.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/avoid-deck-mistakes-fig-a-how-beam-works.jpg" alt="" width="1011" height="740" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1418" />

<strong>The beam, here consisting of two 2x10s, must be strong enough to support the weight of the deck, plus the weight of all the activity that takes place in it. If it bends too much, your deck will feel unstable underfoot.</strong>

[table id=25 responsive=collapse /]

<strong>Use the above span table to determine the minimum size (strength) of your beam. Beam sizes in this table are based on the strength of Ponderosa pine, a relatively weak species. Beams made from stronger wood can often be smaller.</strong>

As you might expect, longer joists put more weight on a beam, so you have to make it bigger and stronger. The same thing happens when you space your posts farther apart. When your post spacing reaches about 10 ft., the beams get big and heavy, sometimes four 2x8s, three 2x10s or larger. In reality, these beams are simply too heavy to handle. They also require wider posts, 4x6s or 4x8s, to rest on.

Fortunately, there's an easy way to make them smaller without sacrificing the overall strength of your deck. Simply add more posts (Fig. C). Adding posts shortens the spans, and as you can see in the table, sharply reduces the beam size needed. Even in this example, you could reduce the beam size from two 2x10s in Fig. A down to one 2x8 in Fig. C. I used two 2x8s rather than one in Fig. C, simply because they make the deck feel a bit stiffer underfoot and fit better atop 4x4 posts.

<strong>A third post shortens the distance the beam must span, so the beam doesn’t have to be as large. According to the span table, one 2x8 does the job, though a second 2x8 was added for additional stiffness.</strong>

In general, your deck will feel firmer if you space your posts no more than 6 in. apart.

<h2>Build to stop rot</h2>

The most damaging weapon nature uses to attack your deck is virtually invisible — rot-causing fungus.

Fungus spreads in the form of thousands of microscopic spores that float through the air. If they find enough moisture, the spores that settle on your freshly built deck will root and grow, slowly dissolving the wood fiber. You'll see it happen as your deck "weathers" to a silver gray in a few years. The surface fungus that causes the color change is a mold that really does no significant damage. But other types of fungus will destroy the wood fiber and weaken your deck’s structure.

Fungus needs moisture to grow, so rot won’t occur in any type of wood if the wood can dry out easily after rainstorms. Most deck wood dries quickly, but a few places remain wet for a long time (Fig. D). That's where fungus takes root.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/avoid-deck-mistakes-fig-d-areas-vulnerable-to-rot.jpg" alt="" width="704" height="565" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1420" />

<strong>Areas of deck wood that absorb water readily yet dry slowly will rot first. Fungus quickly takes root in moist areas. The ends of boards and joints are common trouble spots.</strong>

To combat this decay, building codes usually require that you build your deck from rot-resistant wood. You’ll find three types of wood readily available to do the job:

<ul>
<li>heart redwood,</li>
<li>heart cedar, and</li>
<li>pressure-treated.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Heartwood</h3>

The “heartwood” of redwood and cedar is the deeper-colored core of a tree as compared to the cream-colored outer wood called “sapwood.”

The heartwood contains natural chemicals that are toxic to fungus. They'll hold decay at bay until water slowly leaches these chemicals out of the wood.

Depending on rainfall and moisture conditions in your region, serious signs of decay can begin within 10 years.

<h3>Pressure-treated wood</h3>

Pressure-treated wood lasts longer — almost indefinitely, no matter what species of wood is used. Pressure treatment is a process that forces chemicals that are toxic to fungus (termites, too) virtually throughout the wood fiber of your lumber. The chemicals bond to the fiber and remain there.

The longevity of pressure-treated wood plus its lower cost (20 to 50 percent less than cedar or redwood, depending on your region) make it an excellent choice for most deck projects You can even bury properly treated posts without worrying about them disintegrating.

<h3>How do I buy treated lumber?</h3>

A “.40” rating should be stamped right on the board, which means it contains .40 pounds of preservative per cubic foot of wood.

Inspect the boards to make sure they’re dry. The preservative permanently bonds with the wood only when it dries. So don’t buy boards that seem waterlogged or unusually heavy.

You might have trouble finding dry 4x4s and larger timbers. These take longer to dry after the treatment process, so treatment facilities often ship them out before they're dry. If you have to use them while they're still wet, be sure to observe the safety precautions below.

Also reject wood with chemical residue on its surface; you should see what looks like an even coat of green or brown stain. As a sign of quality, look for the <a href="http://www.awpa.com/references/homeowner.asp">American Wood Protection Association (AWPA)</a> stamp or a lifetime guarantee on each board. But make a visual inspection and use your own judgment, too.

Good quality treated lumber will contain no more than a trace of heartwood, the darker center of a tree. Preservative chemicals often won’t penetrate heartwood, so it can quickly rot.

<h3>Safety precautions for dealing with pressure-treated wood</h3>

Handle treated wood cautiously.

<ul>
<li>Wear goggles when cutting it to keep sawdust away from your eyes.</li>
<li>Wash your hands after working with it, and don’t burn leftover scraps.</li>
<li>Burning the scraps can release the toxic chemical as fumes. Put scraps in the trash instead.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other tips</h3>

Many deck builders don't like the green color or knotty appearance of treated wood. So they keep it out of sight, using it for the joists, beams and posts. Then they switch to cedar or redwood for the highly visible decking and railing.

If you prefer to use redwood or cedar, you can make them last longer by treating them with a chemical preservative yourself. You don't have to treat the entire deck, only the vulnerable areas (Fig. D), especially joints where moisture sinks in and dries out slowly.

Dunk the critical ends of posts and other lumber into a bucket of wood preservative (formulated to resist fungus) for an hour or even a day to let as much preservative as possible soak into the wood. (Wear rubber gloves when you work with preservative to keep it off your skin.)

Homeowners can no longer buy powerful commercial preservatives, so this method won't make your wood as rot resistant as pressure-treated wood. But it can delay rot for several additional years.

<h2>Control wood movement</h2>

Deck surfaces exposed to direct sun and rain take a terrific beating. Every time water soaks them, the wood swells. Then when the sun bakes them dry, the wood shrinks. Over time these repeated movements can cause boards to crack and split. In addition, nails loosen and pop up. Gaps appear at joints. And boards warp. The result is a shabby deck.

On this point, redwood and cedar usually have the edge on pressure-treated wood. Redwood and cedar are relatively soft and light. They don't react as much to wetting/drying cycles as several of the denser types used for pressure treating, like Southern yellow pine. What’s more, the chemicals in treated wood tend to attract moisture, causing treated wood to swell more readily than redwood and cedar.

To solve the problem caused by wetting/drying cycles. processors of top-quality treated wood impregnate some of their wood products with a water repellent so they absorb less moisture, swell less, and therefore crack and warp less. This wood costs 10 to 20 percent more but often comes with a lifetime guarantee. When shopping for deck material, ask your local lumber dealer about this type of treated wood.

Most treated wood doesn't contain a water repellent, but you can brush one on to accomplish the same thing. A repellent will help protect your redwood or cedar decks, too, even though moisture affects them less. (Water repellents are often confused with wood preservatives. A wood preservative is a chemical that’s toxic to wood—destroying fungus, bacteria and insects. A water repellent simply keeps the water out.)

Unfortunately, brushed-on water repellents last only two to three years. You’ll need to recoat your deck as soon as you notice water drops soaking into the wood rather than “beading” and remaining on the surface.

<h2>Types of water repellents</h2>

Paint is the best repellent because it forms a protective skin over the wood. It lasts the longest too. Unfortunately, though, repainting a deck is difficult once the first coat peels. because you have to scrape and sand the wood to prepare for a new coat. The extra effort usually isn't worth the trouble

Clear, skin-forming finishes like varnish and polyurethane also protect well but don't last long. Even special formulations break down and peel under intense sunlight, causing the same recoating problems as paint.

For recoating ease, your best bet is to apply a clear penetrating sealer or an exterior stain that also seals. Neither of these forms a skin on the wood surface that can peel. Penetrating sealers and stains contain resins that partially fill the wood pores and repel water. Because they form a thinner coat than paint, sealers and stains usually last only a few years. They soon wear off high-traffic areas and weather away from areas exposed to direct sun and rain. But when you recoat the deck, you don’t have to scrape off the old finish, so sealers and stains are much easier to reapply than paint.

Moreover, stains come in many colors, so you can blend your deck into the color scheme of your home. For more protection or when the stain doesn't contain a water repellent, apply a clear sealer (or other water repellent) first. Check the containers to make sure the stain and repellent are compatible.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometimes a job’s too big to do yourself. Sometimes it’s too complicated. Sometimes it’s too dirty, too scary, too time-consuming, too heavy, too smelly, or has too many wires sticking out of it (for me, that’s three). So you hire a pro to do it.

Building a fence, though, is different — it’s one job you should save for yourself. Even if you’ve never tackled anything larger than a doghouse, building a fence is a great project for the do-it-yourselfer.

Look at the advantages: You don’t need fancy tools; it won’t disrupt your family’s life the way some big projects do; fences look great but don’t require the skill of a master carpenter; and finally, if you screw up (heaven forbid!) you won’t be damaging your house.

Best of all, though, will be your fence itself. Look at it as you drive up — it’s handsome and impressive. Walk up close and give that post a wiggle — it’s solid and strong. Put your cheek to the wood and sight down the length — it’s perfect. And you made it. It also does those practical things you wanted a fence to do in the first place, like keeping the dog in or the nosy neighbors out.

This story will show you how to build a typical wood fence, easily and successfully There are plenty of other types of fences you could build, from the simplest prefab panel fence to an elaborate historical design, but no matter which one you choose, these techniques will help make your fence a “most-likely-to-succeed” project.
<h2>What it takes to build</h2>
The tools you need to build this fence are simple: hand tools and a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-circular-saw/">circular saw</a> The skill level of this project is intermediate, but it varies a lot depending on how flat your terrain is (flat is easier) and how long your fence is (long is harder). The tricky part of fence building is accurately laying out and setting the posts, not handling the tools.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1456" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-fence-what-it-takes-to-build.jpg" alt="" width="277" height="262" />

Fence building is hard physical work, however. Fence posts are heavy, and digging holes is a chore that can wilt even XXL-size guys If anybody owes you some labor, this is the project to rope them in on.

To give you a rough idea of material costs, a 6-ft. high fence generally costs between $11 and $19 a foot for the lumber if it’s made from cedar or redwood. The materials for this fence, which was made from clear cedar, cost $14 a foot. Made from a knotty grade, it would have cost $11 a foot.
<h2>A side-by-side board fence with a scalloped top</h2>
This design was chosen because it’s easy to build, but looks fancy. The fence boards are simply nailed up side by side, but they’re livened up by having a long curve cut across their tops after assembly (a "scalloped" top). The fence-lumber dealer also sold posts with decorative tops.

A scalloped-top fence is easy to build, economical of materials, and gives plenty of privacy. The disadvantages are that it blocks the breeze, the front looks better than the back, and the decorative post tops require you to be more careful in setting the posts. This fence was made from clear cedar and gave it a natural clear finish to show off the wood.

You may be surprised that I used a footing of tamped dirt and concrete (Fig. A). You don’t need to put a large rock at the bottom of the hole, or gravel to let the water drain. According to my professional fence installer friend, a concrete footing makes the strongest fence support, and tamped dirt lets the water drain away as well as it’s going to.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1451" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-fence-fig-a-scalloped-top-with-decorative-posts-1024x640.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="348" />

Enough said. Let’s build the fence.
<h2>The first step: planning</h2>
The first thing to do is to tell your neighbors you plan to build a fence. A surprise fence is the first volley in many a neighborhood war.

Alter alerting the neighbors, you need to find out two things:
<ol>
 	<li>Where your property lines are, and</li>
 	<li>Where any underground utility lines (gas, electric, phone, and cable) are buried.</li>
</ol>
You may be able to locate the stakes or “monuments” used to mark the corners of your lot (a metal detector helps), but if not, your city or county government can sometimes help. They’ll have plot maps or other documents that give a legal description of your property. <strong>You must have your entire fence, including the footings around the posts, inside your property lines. Hire a surveyor if necessary</strong>.

In most areas, utility companies will mark on the ground where their cables and pipes are if you ask them to. Stay at least 18 in. away from the marks. Or, better yet, <a href="http://call811.com/before-you-dig">call before you dig</a>.

Check with your local building officials to see if the building code regulates fences. Often the code will require that the better side of the fence face out, toward the street or neighbors (that’s a surprise, isn’t it?). There may also be restrictions on fence height or how close you can be to property lines (called “setback”)
<h2>Map out your fence</h2>
Once you know the legal requirements, put up stakes and strings to mark the location of your fence posts. The strings should be at least 6 in. inside your property lines. Make a map of your fence on graph paper, showing the length of each section.

Now calculate how far apart the posts will be for each section of fence. The posts should be 8ft. apart or less, from the center of one post to the center of the next. Here’s how to figure it:
<ul>
 	<li>Take the total length of the section in inches and divide it by 96.</li>
 	<li>Take that number and round it up to the next highest whole number.</li>
 	<li>Divide the total length of the fence section by that number.</li>
 	<li>The result is the center-to-center distance.</li>
</ul>
If you want a gate, decide on its location. It should be on as level a spot as possible, with the hinge on the downhill side. The opening for the gate should be a whole multiple of the fence board width, plus 3/4 in. (Fig. C).

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1453" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-fence-fig-c-gate-construction-1024x463.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="252" />

Mark the post and gate locations and the distance between post centers on your fence map.
<h2>Ordering materials</h2>
Using your fence map as a guide, order your lumber, concrete, and fasteners. A fence dealer will have the best selection of lumber.

All the lumber for this fence is rough cut, rather than planed smooth. Surprisingly, “dog-eared" fence boards (the kind with the corners cut off; see Photo 13) are so popular that they’re cheaper than plain boards, so I bought them and cut the ends off when I cut the scalloped tops (Photo 13). For common grade fence material. allow 10 percent extra for waste. For clear grades, 5 percent.

If you’re mixing the concrete yourself. figure about two 80-lb. bags per post. Otherwise. figure roughly 1 yard of concrete for 40 posts.

Choose aluminum. stainless steel or hot-dipped (not electroplated) galvanized nails to minimize rust staining. You can recognize hot-dipped nails by their rough texture.
<h2>Setting the corner posts</h2>
The first step in building your fence is to set the posts on the ends and corners of the fence. It’s important that the posts be deep enough: 32 in. deep is the minimum for a 6-ft.-tall fence.

Dig the holes with a clamshell-type posthole digger (Photo 1), making sure that the holes are flat and solid on the bottom.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1430" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-fence-01-dig-holes.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="692" />

<strong>Begin by digging holes for the pre-cut corner and end posts. Strings and stakes mark the fence location, just inside your property lines.</strong>

Adjust the posts so they’re the right height above the ground. by either tamping extra dirt at the bottom of the hole or by deepening the hole. Remember that a fence like this one, with pre-cut decorative post tops, must have the posts set to the right height. On other fences. for example. those with posts that have nailed-on caps or finials. You can set posts extra high and trim them off after the stringers are nailed on (Photo 19).

When a post is the right height, tamp 6 to 8 in of dirt around the base to keep the post <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/straight-square-plumb-and-level/">plumb (straight up and down)</a> in both directions (Photo 2).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1431" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-fence-02-tamp-dirt.jpg" alt="" width="445" height="421" />

<strong>Tamp 6-8 in. of dirt around the corner post: to hold them, doing an inch or two at a time. Make sure the post is straight up and down and the right height above the ground.</strong>

Tamping dirt is a simple activity, but it takes a little practice to get it right. Do an inch or two of dirt at a time, tamping evenly around the post and using your level to test for plumb. Start gently and then tamp harder as you go around. If you try to tamp hard right away, it’ll push the post to the side. A length of 3/4-in. pipe makes a great tamping tool.

Tie a mason’s string line between your corner posts and end posts, at the height of the bottom of the lower stringer (Photo 3). This string will be used to locate all the other posts, so pull it tight and check its position twice.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1432" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-fence-03-set-string-line.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="498" />

<strong>Set a string line between the corner and end posts at the height of the lower 2x4 stringer. Mark the other post locations on the string with a felt-tip marker.</strong>

Measure from your string to the ground to see how the slope changes. See the “Dealing with Slopes” section below to determine how you’ll need to adjust the string line, and perhaps your corner and end posts, to get your fence to follow the contours of your lawn.

Using a felt-tip marker, mark the string to locate where the remaining posts and gate posts will go.
<h2>Setting intermediate posts</h2>
You can dig the rest of the postholes by hand or use a power auger (Photo 4) if your soil isn’t too rocky. Either way, locate each hole so 2/3 of it is inside the line, and 1/3 is outside (Photo 4, inset).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1433" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-fence-04-dig-remaining-holes.jpg" alt="" width="885" height="671" />

<strong>Dig the remaining postholes and set the posts in tamped dirt. You can use a power auger, with the hole 2/3 of the way inside the string line.</strong>

The little, one person power auger (Photo 4) is pretty gruesome work. If I were doing it again. I’d get a larger, two-person machine and get my brother-in-law (who sure owes me!) to come over and pitch in. <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/c/augers_equipment_rental">You can rent one</a> and it’ll save you tons of time and sweat.

After your holes are dug, mark on your remaining posts where the bottom of the lower stringer will be. Set the posts in their holes, lining up that mark with the string liner. Add well-tamped dirt to raise the post, or dig the hole a little deeper, as needed.

Tamp 6 to 8 in. of dirt around each post to hold it in place. Make sure that each post is:
<ol>
 	<li>plumb in both directions,</li>
 	<li>at the right height in relation to the string line,</li>
 	<li>square to the string line, and</li>
 	<li>just barely touching it.</li>
</ol>
Don’t let the posts push the string line outward. If any of your posts are bowed. arrange the bow so it’s parallel to the fence.

A common problem is rocks.
<ul>
 	<li>Try <strong>prying with a pick and pry bar</strong>. If that doesn’t work, you have several options.</li>
 	<li>If the rock is a foot or more deep, just <strong>cut off the end of the post</strong> (intermediate posts only).</li>
 	<li>You can also <strong>move the post to one side</strong> — in the direction of the fence only — without it being very noticeable.</li>
 	<li>As a last resort, you can <strong>shift the bottom of the post</strong> in or out an inch or two in the direction perpendicular to the fence. If you keep the tops of the post in line, the fence will still look straight, even if the bottom edge sticks out in one spot.</li>
</ul>
Tree roots are less of a problem. Cut the smaller ones and move the post around the larger ones.

Stand back now. and look at the posts.

Do they look straight up and down? Stand on a ladder and look down the tops. Are they in a line (Photo 5)? Are they the right height? When you look from the side, do the tops of the posts make a straight line or a pleasantly smooth curve? Since the posts are just tamped in place, you can adjust them as much as you want, so get fussy. Get your posts just right and the rest of the fence will follow.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1434" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-fence-05-check-posts-plumb.jpg" alt="" width="347" height="347" />

<strong>Check the posts to be sure they’re plumb, they line up straight, and the tops form an even line. Because the posts are set in dirt, you can adjust them if necessary.</strong>

After the posts get your final approval, and if it’s a calm day, fill the holes with concrete (Photo 6).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1435" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-fence-06-fill-holes-concrete.jpg" alt="" width="469" height="527" />

<strong>Fill the holes with concrete, after making a final check that the posts are plumb, square to the line, and in a smooth line.</strong>

Mound the concrete up and trowel the top of it smooth, so it sheds water well (Photo 7). Let the concrete cure overnight.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1436" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-fence-07-trowel-tops.jpg" alt="" width="457" height="406" />

<strong>Trowel the tops of the concrete footings to shed water. After a year, you can caulk the gap between the wood and concrete.</strong>
<h2>Dealing with slopes</h2>
There is no cut-and-dried, carefully measured, mathematically precise way to get a fence to look right on irregular terrain (and that’s what most of us have). It’s a matter of trusting your eye and making adjustments.

You have two basic choices:
<h3>Straight fence</h3>
For a straight fence (Fig. B below), you set the corner posts, string your line, and set the height of the remaining posts a fixed distance above that line.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Advantage</strong>: the fence looks good.</li>
 	<li><strong>Disadvantage</strong>: you may have large gaps and humps under it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fence following the ground</h3>
To have a fence follow the ground, each post is set to a fixed height above the ground.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Advantage</strong>: there is a constant. even gap at the bottom of the fence.</li>
 	<li><strong>Disadvantage</strong>: following minor humps and hollows can make your fence look jagged, which you may not like.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The best solution: compromise</h3>
A good-looking fence is usually a compromise between being straight and following the terrain. It follows a smooth curve or has just a few changes in slope.

You can accomplish this by adjusting the height of intermediate posts where there is a change in slope (Fig. B).

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1452" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-fence-fig-b-sloping-land-1024x611.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="332" />

Put a nail in these posts at the lower stringer height, and wrap your string line around it, so your string line can still be used as a reference. You can soften an abrupt change in slope by adjusting the heights of a couple of posts on either side of the break in slope. Remember, as long as the posts are just set in tamped dirt, you can adjust them to get the line of the fence just right.

For small humps and hollows, you can cut or fill the soil, cut some of the fence boards to fit, or use a few longer fence boards.

If you have complicated slopes, it will be easier to install a fence style that allows you to trim off the tops of the posts after they’re set (see the “Other popular fences” section below).
<h2>Nail on the stringers</h2>
You’ll save a lot of walking if you start by laying out the stringers by pairs all along your fence (This project used a wheelbarrow to carry the boards.)

You put up a stringer like this:
<ul>
 	<li>Hold it up to the posts at the right height and mark each end for cutting.</li>
 	<li>Trim off the ends, then toenail (nail diagonally) the stringer to the posts at each end, keeping the ends at just the right height.</li>
</ul>
The trick to doing this quickly, easily and accurately is to use a couple of 2x4 blocks and a pair of 38in. spacer boards made of 1x6. Tack these onto the posts to locate the stringers and hold them for nailing (Photos 8 and 9).

The 2x4 blocks hold the lower stringer, first for marking, and then for toenailing. The 1x6 spacers locate the upper stringer a precise distance above the lower stringer, then hold it for toenailing.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1437" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-fence-08-a-lower-stringer.jpg" alt="" width="603" height="614" />

<strong>2X4 blocks, tacked on temporarily, hold the lower stringer while you mark it for cutting the ends. They also hold the stringer in position so you can nail it on without a helper.</strong>

If you’ve ever done it, you know that the bugaboo of toenailing is that the board shifts as you nail it. The blocks and spacer boards will keep your stringers in the right spot.

Toenail the stringers with three 10d galvanized nails at each end, centering the stringer on the post. The lower stringer should have two nails on the side and one on the top edge. The upper stringer should get two nails on the edges and one on the side. When you nail on the side, do it on the side where the fence boards will be attached, in order to hide the nails. If you have warped stringers, use them on the bottom, not the top.

<strong>Toenail the stringers into the posts with galvanized nails. The spacer boards and 2x4 blocks keep the stringers from shifting as you nail them.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1439" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-fence-09-upper-stringer.jpg" alt="" width="498" height="343" />

<strong>Spacer boards hold the upper stringer for both marking the end cuts and nailing. They also ensure that the upper and lower stringers are parallel.</strong>
<h2>Nail on the fence boards</h2>
Now for the fun part! Spread your fence boards out along the fence as you did the stringers, and start nailing them up. Once again, a jig (Photo 10) will make this part of the project go quickly and accurately, guaranteeing that the tops of all the fence boards are the right height above the upper stringer.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1440" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-fence-10-nailing-jig.jpg" alt="" width="532" height="457" />

<strong>Nail on the fence boards using a jig to make sure the tops of the boards on parallel to the upper stringer. Keep the boards plumb as you nail them.</strong>

Start at one post and nail the boards to the upper stringer only with two 7d galvanized box nails. The jig ensures that each board will be at the right height. Do all the boards between two posts this way. If the gap left at the second post is uniform, top to bottom, go back and nail the boards to the bottom stringer.

If the gap at the end is 3 in. wide or more, just rip the last board to fit (Photo 11).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1441" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-fence-11-fill-the-gap.jpg" alt="" width="534" height="380" />

<strong>Fill the gap left at the end of a section of fence boards by cutting the last one.</strong>

If the gap is 1 to 3 in. wide, rip the last two boards. If the gap is less than an inch, remove a few boards and leave slight gaps between them when you nail them back on.

After all the boards are nailed on, mark the curved cuts that give the fence its scalloped look. For each post-to-post section, tack on three nails, two on the posts just at the tops of the boards, and the other in the middle of the fence section, 6 in. down from the other nails (Fig. A).

A strip of 1/4—in. hardboard or plywood, bent between these nails, will form a smooth curve from which you can trace the cutting line (Photo 12).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1442" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-fence-12-trace-curve.jpg" alt="" width="415" height="421" />

<strong>Trace the curves for the top of the fence boards using a thin strip of 1/4-in. hardboard bent between three nails.</strong>

Cut out the curve with a jigsaw, finishing the end of the cut with a coping saw if necessary, and smooth the cut edge of the boards with a rasp (Photo 13).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1443" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-fence-13-cut-curve.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="372" />

<strong>Cut the curves with a jigsaw, finishing the ends with a coping saw if necessary. Smooth the cut ends of the boards with a rasp.</strong>
<h2>Building the gate</h2>
The trick to building a gate is to tack it together on the ground, using only two nails for each board (Photo 14).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1444" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-fence-14-assemble-gate.jpg" alt="" width="351" height="377" />

<strong>Assemble the gate on the ground, using only one nail on each end of the board, so the gate stays somewhat flexible.</strong>

You can then fit it into the opening, twist it so the stringers line up on either side, then finish nailing. Then lay a 2x4 across the stringers for a diagonal brace, trace the ends, and cut it to fit (Fig. C above and Photo 15 below).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1445" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-fence-15-twist-gate.jpg" alt="" width="494" height="614" />

<strong>Twist the gate so the stringers line up with those on either side. Then finish nailing on the boards and add a diagonal 2x4 brace.</strong>

Toenail the diagonal brace in place, being sure that it points from the latch side down to the hinge side. rather than the reverse. (This is the cause of many a sagging gate.) Cut the scalloped top on the gate, then mount the hardware as shown in Fig. C above.
<h2>Final touches</h2>
Left to weather naturally, cedar will turn gray. Although this is acceptable to many people and doesn’t affect the longevity of the wood much, this project treated the fence with a clear water-repellent sealer to keep it golden brown (Photo 16).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1446" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-fence-16-apply-finish.jpg" alt="" width="429" height="543" />

<strong>A clear finish brings out the warm cedar colors but must be reapplied every few years. Without it, cedar weathers to a light silver.</strong>

Any sealer that’s designed for cedar decks will work. However, be warned: you’ll have to reapply the finish every few years to keep it looking fresh. It cost $2 a foot to finish this fence.

After your fence has been up for a year, it’s recommended that you caulk between the concrete footing and the post to keep water out.
<h2>Other popular fences</h2>
There are a million styles of fences, and half the fun of building one yourself is choosing and designing it. You’ll probably see a wide variety of fences right in your own neighborhood.

The building method shown for the scallop-top fence is typical for most fences. If you want to build another style, here’s a brief description of three of the most popular ones:
<h3>Alternate Board Fence</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1448" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-fence-18-alternate-board.jpg" alt="" width="538" height="357" />

This fence looks equally good from both sides, is very easy to build, allows good ventilation, and follows ground contours well.

This fence is an example of one where you can set the posts without worrying about height, and trim the posts after the top stringer is nailed on (Photo 19).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1449" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-fence-19-cut-topsof-posts.jpg" alt="" width="333" height="350" />

<strong>Cut tops of posts on an alternate board fence to length after upper stringer is nailed on. This is a dangerous cut because the saw can kick back out of your control. You can use a handsaw for more safety.</strong>

This makes setting posts go much faster. The 1x6 fence boards should be spaced about 3-1/2 in. apart on each side (use a jig), although the last few can be varied to fit.
<h3>Picket Fence</h3>
This is one of the easiest fences to build. It provides more of a visual boundary than it does privacy or protection. Fence dealers carry a wide variety of decorative out pickets and matching posts.

Posts should be buried a minimum of 24 in. deep, and typically they are 7 ft. long. You can use just tamped dirt for the till on intermediate posts, but concrete is better and should definitely be used on corner, end, and gate posts. Space standard 1x4 pickets about 2-1/2 in. apart, with the stringers 27 in. apart for a 4ft. fence. Use four nails per picket.
<h3>Overlapped Board Fence with Lattice</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1447" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-fence-17-lattice-top.jpg" alt="" width="543" height="555" />

This is one of the more complicated fences to build, though it’s also one where doing it yourself will save the most money.

It gives good privacy, is very strong (because of the overlapping boards), it’s hard to climb and has a classy look. For slopes. It must go down in steps (Fig. B). A table saw is almost a necessity to rip the thin nailing strips for this fence.

In this example, the posts run long and are topped with a beveled cap that was cut on a table saw. You can adapt this design to make a fence that’s entirely lattice, or one that’s entirely overlapping board. The details of the construction are shown in Fig. D.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1429" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-fence-752x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="758" />

		<title>6 Steps for PROPERLY Exterior Painting Your Home</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ah, springtime. The trees are budding, the grass is greening and it’s time to paint your house. Again.

And if your “again” came all too soon for you, say less than four years, and you really would like to get five years or more out of a paint job, this is the information you’re looking to.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1462" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/exterior-painting.jpg" alt="" width="991" height="707" />

<strong>Painting your house doesn't have to be an ongoing event. But even the best paint won’t last if you don't prepare the surface.</strong>

You’ll see the steps to take for a successful, long-lasting paint job. And you may be surprised to see that there are only six of them:
<ol>
 	<li>Power washing</li>
 	<li>Scraping</li>
 	<li>Sanding</li>
 	<li>Filling holes</li>
 	<li>Caulking</li>
 	<li>Priming</li>
</ol>
Sorry, none of them is easy. But each one is essential.
<h2>Do your prep work</h2>
I don’t care if the paint you use costs $15 or $50 a gallon, if the surface you paint hasn‘t been properly prepared, you’re wasting your money and your time. And quite frankly, most of us don’t have three or four weekends to dedicate to painting the house every other year. I sure don’t.

So, what are the steps to a successful paint job?
<h2>Power Washing</h2>
The cleaner the surface to be painted, the better the job.

There's no way around this fact. And power washing is the best way to clean off the dirt and peeling or flaking paint from your house. Besides, after you powerwash your house, you may even discover that your house was only dirty and doesn’t really need painting yet. (You can at least hope for this pleasant discovery!)

Residential-use power washers are rated at pounds-per-square-inch (psi) pressure. You’ll get the best results if you use a unit that's rated between 1,200 and 2,500 psi.

You can wash most types of siding with a power washer. However, if your house has wood siding, be careful not to gauge it with the high-pressure stream of water that these units generate.

Keep the wand at least 12 in. from the siding (Photo 1).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1463" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/exterior-painting-1-power-wash.jpg" alt="" width="611" height="503" />

<strong>Power wash your house to remove dirt and pooling or flaking paint. Keep the wand at least 12 in. from the siding to prevent damage to the siding. Wear eye protection.</strong>

A good cleaning agent, such as tri-sodium phosphate (TSP), will blast away the everyday buildup of dirt and other air pollutants that end up on your home’s siding. TSP is banned in some states, so check for any restrictions in your area.

You can <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/c/pressure_washer_equipment_rental">rent</a> <a href="https://www.unitedrentals.com/marketplace/equipment/surface-preparation/pressure-washers">power washers</a> for $80 to $120 a day. If you can’t get TSP, an all-purpose cleaner is usually sold where you rent the power washer.
<h2>Scraping</h2>
Even with the most thorough power washing, you’ll probably need to scrape some areas. The best tool we’ve found is a long-handled scraper, like the one shown in Photo 2. It sells for around $20 and is available at hardware and paint stores and home centers.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1464" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/exterior-painting-2-scrape.jpg" alt="" width="606" height="509" />

<strong>Scrape all loose paint, down to the bare wood. If a painted area can’t be scraped off, don’t worry. That paint is bonded to the siding and is okay to paint over.</strong>

This type of scraper works with a pushing and pulling motion, and it will remove even the toughest peeling or flaking paint. Remember to scrape with the grain of the wood to avoid gouging the surface.

Each curved blade has two scraping edges. When scraping becomes more difficult, simply turn the blade around. You won't have to work as hard and you'll get better results.

Keep an extra set of blades on hand, too. The blades will get dull.
<h2>Lead paint</h2>
A word of caution about lead paint. If your house was built before 1972. The paint that was used probably contained toxic levels of lead, If you need to scrape, take the following precautions:
<ul>
 	<li>Wear a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/respirators/">good-quality face mask</a> that's designed to protect you against lead particles. (The typical paper dust mask does not protect you from lead dust.) Good masks are available at most paint and hardware stores.</li>
 	<li>Wear old clothes that you can throw away when you're done. This eliminates the chance of spreading the dust.</li>
 	<li>Use drop cloths to catch the paint chips. Check with your local health department for instructions on how to dispose of them in your area.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sanding</h2>
Once all of the loose paint has been scraped, you need to “feather” the rough edges, that is, get rid of the edge between the scraped area and the bare wood. To do this, it’s best to use a sanding block (Photo 3). They cost about $8-10 at hardware stores.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1465" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/exterior-painting-3-sand.jpg" alt="" width="523" height="425" />

<strong>Sand all of the scraped areas using a sanding block and sandpaper. Feather the edges smooth between the paint and the bare wood. Start with 40-grit sandpaper and progress to 100-grit sandpaper.</strong>

Sanding with the proper grade sandpaper will make this part of the preparation easier. Start with an extra-coarse (40-grit) sandpaper and then a medium (100-grit). It’s usually not necessary to go all the way to a fine (180- to 200-grit) sandpaper.

Again, wear a face mask to protect yourself from the dust if you suspect the old paint may contain lead.
<h2>Filling</h2>
Even with a good scraping and careful sanding, you’ll still have spots where the bare wood is much lower than the old bonded paint. Too low. in fact. to sand completely smooth.

When this happens. you should fill these areas with a surfacing compound designed for exterior use (Photo 4). Use a 4- to 6-in, broad knife to ensure smooth application. You’ll find this type of filler and knife at most paint and hardware stores.

After the filler dries, usually within 30 to 60 minutes, sand it smooth with 100-grit sandpaper.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1466" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/exterior-painting-4-fill.jpg" alt="" width="482" height="428" />

<strong>Fill any low spots on the bare wood and painted surface with an exterior-grade surfacing compound. After the compound dries, sand it smooth with 100-grit sandpaper.</strong>
<h2>Caulking</h2>
To get the best-looking paint job, as well as prevent drafts indoors and save on energy costs, you should caulk all of the joints — where the siding meets the windows and door trim (Photo 5). These joint areas often have large gaps.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1467" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/exterior-painting-5-caulk.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="426" />

<strong>Caulk all joints between the siding and the window and door trim. Use a paintable acrylic latex or silicone acrylic caulk. Caulk under door thresholds and windowsills, too.</strong>

Scrape out all of the old caulk. Re-caulk the joints with a good-quality, paintable acrylic latex ($5-10 a tube) or silicone acrylic caulk ($7-12 a tube).

Latex caulk should be applied before you paint. Silicone caulks may or may not be paintable. Check the label. Non-paintable caulks must be applied after painting — paint won't adhere to them.

Caulk around outdoor electrical boxes, outdoor water faucets, and exterior lights. Don‘t forget to caulk under the door thresholds and windowsills.
<h2>Priming</h2>
Before you even think about applying the paint, you must prime any bare wood. If you don’t, the new paint won't adhere properly. Period!

Prime any new wood or scraped and sanded bare wood surfaces (Photo 6). Also, prime the filled areas. Then use either a latex- or oil-based top coat.

Primer is usually white. but you can have the paint dealer tint the primer so it’s about the color of your finish coat. This will assure good coverage on your final coat.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1468" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/exterior-painting-6-prime.jpg" alt="" width="519" height="425" />

<strong>Prime all bare wood or scraped and sanded surfaces. Have the paint dealer tint the primer to a color that’s close to the top coat color for better coverage.</strong>

		<title>Simple Adirondack Chair Plans (Weekend Build)</title>
		<link>http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/adirondack-chair-plans/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Meet the “weekend chair” — it takes just a weekend to build, and you’ll spend many a weekend in it afterward.

This chair is built for comfort, with wide arms, a curved back (unlike many commercial Adirondack chairs), and a deeply scooped seat that‘ll make you say “ahhh” every time you sink down into it.

It’s a cinch to build, too, a great project for the <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/new-hobby-woodworking/">beginning woodworker</a>. All you do is cut out the pieces, drill some holes and screw the chair together — no messing around with glue and no fussy joints to cut. The only power tools you'll need are a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/how-to-use-a-jigsaw/">jigsaw</a> and a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-drill-driver-kit/">drill</a>. You do need to use one specialized woodworking technique: transferring the shapes of the curved parts from the grids in the drawings to your wood. You’ll see how to do this later, but if you don't even want to bother with that, you can send for full-size patterns for the parts.

This chair was made from cedar. because it's naturally rot resistant and has a rich color. Cypress, heart redwood, or treated pine would also be good choices, and pine or oak would be acceptable if the chair is protected from moisture, as on a porch. To make this chair completely weatherproof, I recommend galvanized deck screws and stainless steel carriage bolts, nuts and washers. Ordinary steel screws and bolts rust and discolor the wood.

Cedar is a soft wood. It mars easily, so take care not to dent the pieces when you cut and assemble them. Cedar also weathers to a gray color, so if you want to keep your chair looking golden brown, give it a coat of water-repellent preservative every year or so. Ask your paint store for a finish suitable for cedar decks.

Enough said. Let's build the chair.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1482" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/adirondack-chair-plans-782x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="729" />
<h2>Cutting out the pieces</h2>
Begin by cutting all the pieces (A-L) to the sizes given in the Cutting List below.

Then cut the curved edges on the parts that need it. To do this, you must transfer the shape of the parts from the grids on the drawing (Fig. A) to the wood rectangles you just cut. Here's how.

The arms, seat supports, back slats and arm supports (A, C, E, F, and G) come in pairs — two identical parts are required for each. The back supports (J and K) are also the same shape, just different lengths. To save work, transfer the grid shapes for the curved parts to only one of each piece Cut that part out and use it as a template to mark the remaining piece or pieces

To transfer a shape. draw a grid of 1-in. by 1-in. squares as shown in Fig. A onto the rectangular part. Working on one square at a time, copy by eye the curved line from our drawing to the grid on your wood. Use a pencil, lightly.

The trick is to do one square at a time, rather than trying to make the whole curve at once.

Once you're done, connect the whole thing into a smooth curve.

Since a pencil tends to follow the grain of the wood, giving you an uneven curve. use a fine-tip felt marker for the final line.

After you’ve transferred the shapes, cut them out and sand the sawn edges (Photos 1 and 2) Notice that the center back slat (B) is tapered on both sides. Now trace and cut the remaining curved pieces, Also cut the 45-degree upper ends of the back braces (L).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1476" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/adirondack-chair-1-saw-curved-parts.jpg" alt="" width="377" height="356" />

<strong>Saw the curved parts with a jigsaw and a fine-tooth blade. Go slowly and cut right on the lines. This part is the seat support.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1477" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/adirondack-chair-2-sand-parts.jpg" alt="" width="379" height="343" />

<strong>Sand the sawn edges with 80-grit sandpaper and a sanding block. Cedar is a soft wood, so only a little sanding is needed.</strong>
<h2>Drill the holes</h2>
All the screws that hold this chair together have their heads countersunk so they’re flush with the wood surface.

Sometimes beginning woodworkers have trouble getting a smooth, chatter-free countersink hole. The trick is to drill the countersink first (Photo 3), then the hole for the shank of the screw.

Don't get mixed up when you drill the countersink holes in the two back braces (L); there must be a right and a left one. Make them mirror images instead of identical.

Once you’ve drilled the countersink holes, go back and drill a 1/8-in. “clearance hole” through every countersink hole. A clearance hole is the same diameter as the screw, as opposed to a pilot hole. which is narrower.

Drill the bolt holes in the legs (D) and the back ends of the arms (A). The remaining bolt holes in the seat supports (C) and back braces (L) will be drilled during the assembly.

<strong>Countersink the screw holes before you drill them for smoothest, splinter-free results. Then screw these slats on to form the seat.</strong>
<h2>Assemble the seat</h2>
Start assembling the seat by screwing the front and rear seat slats (H) to the seat supports. Cedar splits easily so you should drill a 1/16-in. pilot hole for each screw as you assemble the chair. This will keep the wood from splitting.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1594" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/countersink-drill-bit-set-snappy-5-piece.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="520" />

The above photo shows the best pilot hole and countersink drill bit set. It's the Snappy 40030, American made and a great quality. It's fully compatible with quick-change chucks (1/4 hex shank), very practical, and offer great value for your money. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XXZME8/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Click here to see the price at Amazon.</a>

Now line up the remaining seat slats on the seat supports and screw them on. Use a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/best-drill-bit-set/">Phillips head driver bit</a> in your electric drill to speed this up. Some 1/4-in. thick spacers placed between the seat slats will help you align them.
<h2>Attach the legs</h2>
Clamp the legs (D) to the assembled seat at the location shown in Fig. A.

Use a square to adjust the legs so they are perpendicular to your work surface. When the chair is resting on four points and the legs are square and in the right location, drill bolt holes through the legs and seat supports (Photo 4). Bolt the legs and seat supports together.

<strong>Drill bolt holes through the leg while it’s clamped to the seat in the proper position. Then bolt them together with galvanized or stainless steel bolts.</strong>
<h2>Assemble the back</h2>
Line up the center of the center back slat (B) with the center of the lower back support (J), then screw these pieces together Now cut four 1/4-in. thick x 30-in. long wood spacers.

Arrange the remaining back slats (E and F) on the lower back support with the 1/4-in. spacers placed between them. Screw the slats on.

Now set the upper back support (K) in position, line up the outer slats so they're flush with the ends of the support, and screw the pieces together (Photo 5).

Finally, screw the assembled back onto the seat through the lower support.

<strong>Thin spacers made of scrap wood will help you get the slats perfectly aligned while you screw them to the back supports.</strong>
<h2>Attach the arms and braces</h2>
Screw the arm supports (G) to the legs, then screw the arms to the legs and arm supports Then screw the back braces (L) to the upper back support, but don’t screw them to the seat supports yet.

Align the back edges of the arms with the back braces. drill the bolt holes through them both (Photo 6), and attach the carriage bolts Now screw the back braces to the seat supports.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1481" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/adirondack-chair-6-drill-bolt-holes.jpg" alt="" width="716" height="655" />

<strong>Drill the bolt holes through the arms and back braces at once, rather than trying to get holes to line up. Make sure the back edges are flush.</strong>
<h2>Apply the exterior finish</h2>
I know this sounds crazy, but the best way to apply wood preservative or another finish to your chair is to take it completely apart — it doesn't take that long — and finish the parts separately.

This allows the finish to penetrate evenly and thoroughly, especially the end grain, which is most subject to rot.

With the chair disassembled, sand the parts. especially the exposed edges, and apply the wood preservative following the directions on the can. Be sure to rest the pieces on their backsides or unexposed edges so the finish will dry evenly and not leave marks.

Apply at least two coats of finish. When it's dry, reassemble the chair, sit back and relax!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The smart gardener’s time-saving, water-conserving, weed-busting magic carpet.

Talk about a landscaping product! It slashes water bills, improves the health and appearance of your plants, and saves your aching back. You don’t have to plug it in or buy a service warranty for it. There’s no assembly required. What I’m trying to sell you on is simple, down-to-earth <strong>mulch</strong>.

We can learn a lot about mulch from Mother Nature. Take a walk through any woods and notice the forest floor, layered in pine needles or leaves — it's soft and moist; there are few weeds or competing plants; the air is cool; the trees are robust.

Serious vegetable gardeners have used and praised mulch for years. Now it's time for the rest of us to become familiar with its benefits. So vital is mulching that one bill introduced in water-starved California includes it as one of its seven key points. (Read this carefully; someday soon you could be ticketed for failure to mulch!)

Whether you’re creating new planting beds or rearranging old ones, mulch should be an integral part of your plan. Here’s why.
<h2>Mulch: what it is, what it does</h2>
Mulch is any material spread atop the soil in planting beds (Photos 1-3). It may be organic (plant and tree materials) or inorganic (rock and stone).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1501" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/marvelous-mulch-1-cocoa-bean-hulls.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="426" />

<strong>Cocoa bean hulls and other finely ground organic materials make excellent mulches for annual and perennial flower beds. Weed barriers are not ordinarily used in flower beds.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1502" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/marvelous-mulch-2-bark.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="448" />

<strong>Bark and other wood products provide an excellent mulch around ornamental bushes and shrubs. They provide excellent benefits with or without a weed barrier — if you use one, make sure it’s fabric.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1503" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/marvelous-mulch-3-washed-gravel.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="448" />

<strong>Washed gravel, rock, and stone provide a permanent mulch in established planting beds. Always use a plastic or fabric weed barrier beneath rock beds and beware of rocks negative effects.</strong>

Whatever its size, shape, or form, mulch can:
<ul>
 	<li>Greatly reduce soil moisture loss. One-third of the water we consume around our homes is used on our landscaping — and half of that is wasted through evaporation. Mulch acts like a one-way door; it allows water into the soil but blocks its departure through evaporation. Mulch also limits soil erosion and runoff.</li>
 	<li>Eliminate or suppress weed growth. A 3- to 4-in. layer of mulch makes it difficult for weed seeds to work their way into the soil. And by blocking light, mulch makes it harder for seeds that do sneak into the soil to germinate and grow. If a weed does struggle through (and a few Rambo-like weeds like thistle and quack grass surely will), it'll be easier to pull because the soil is loose and moist. This means you can get by with few or no chemicals and weed killers.</li>
 	<li>Protect soil and plants from temperature extremes. Mulch acts like insulation; it keeps the ground cool on hot days and warm on cold days. It helps moderate and protect roots and plants from traumatic day-night, freeze-thaw cycles.</li>
 	<li>Promote vigorous growth in young plants. Seedlings and newly planted trees and shrubs have a shallow root system, totally dependent on rain or manual watering for moisture. Mulch holds that moisture in the soil for their use.</li>
 	<li>Enrich the soil. Mulches add valuable nutrients to the soil as they decompose. Earthworms are attracted to the cool, rich soil beneath. Soil that normally bakes to a hard crust stays loose and moist.</li>
 	<li>Provide a protective buffer between your plants and trees and the damage your lawn mower and string trimmer dish out.</li>
 	<li>Improve your landscape's appearance by adding color and texture to your planting beds. Mulch prevents mud from splashing your house and plants during rains and provides a clean “carpet” for you to walk on as you tend your garden. Mulch also helps visually fill in space while young plants grow to maturity to round out a planting bed.</li>
</ul>
There is no perfect mulch. When selecting one, weigh the pros and cons — how it will look vs. how it will perform; how long it will last vs. how hard it is to maintain.
<h2>Organic mulches</h2>
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>Shredded and chipped bark, compost, pine needles, corn husks. grass clippings, peanut shells —— anything that will let air and water through but not blow away can be used. The smaller the mulch, the closer it packs to keep out weed seeds.</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>Shredded and chipped tree and bark products</strong> are the most popular mulches. Cedar, redwood, and hardwoods, like oak or maple. last longer and are less likely to promote mold than pine and other softwood. Shredded-type mulches interweave into a single large mass, making them less likely to blow or float away. This makes them ideal for use on sloped hillsides or in areas where water splashes from roof overhangs. Expect to pay between 55¢ and $1.10 per sq. ft. of 3-in. deep wood mulch.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Grass clippings, leaves and leaf mold</strong> are home-grown mulches you can use. They do everything a good mulch should do —just use them with care. They break down rapidly, so don't use a weed barrier beneath them. Beware of grass clippings that contain heavy doses of lawn fertilizer or weed killer: these may harm your plants. They may also change the balance of your soil. Grass and leaves may smell as they decompose, so you may want to experiment with them on more remote planting beds.</li>
 	<li><strong>Peanut, cottonseed and cocoa hulls</strong> make excellent mulches, especially in flower beds. Cocoa hulls smell sweet and chocolaty after a rain — a pro or con depending on your love of chocolate (Photo 1).</li>
 	<li><strong>Straw, hay and pine needles</strong> make inexpensive, easily renewed mulches. Use hay and straw that was cut before going to seed. Pine needles tend to make the soil more acidic, which is fine for plants like azaleas and philodendrons, but not for others.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>Compost</strong> provides protection and slowly feeds nutrients to the soil. Many people place wood chips or other mulches on top of a thinner layer of compost.
<h2>Rock and stone</h2>
Rock can add color, texture, and variety to your landscape It can range from plain gravel to volcanic rock to multi-colored stone, and costs between $1 and $2 per sq. ft. (plus delivery) when spread 3 in. deep.

Use rock with caution. It's expensive, heavy and permanent. Stone can indeed complement the stone or brickwork of your home — but can also be hard-edged and out of character with landscaping, which is intended to soften the rigid lines of your home, driveway, and sidewalk

When considering rock, remember:
<ul>
 	<li>Rock can overheat plants and damage tender stems and leaves It can act as a heat sink and literally bake some shrubs, especially low-growing ones like junipers. This is an important consideration with south-facing planting beds.</li>
 	<li>Rock shouldn't be used around groundcover-type plants that spread by dropping feeders that take root and grow.</li>
 	<li>Rock can crowd out or damage the stems of plants as they grow. Organic mulches easily move aside to accommodate the growing trunk of a tree or shrub; not so a layer of rock.</li>
 	<li>A fabric or plastic weed barrier must always be used with rock. Otherwise, weed seeds will easily wash down into the unprotected soil.</li>
 	<li>Rocks that find their way from the planting bed to your lawn present a danger when they’re thrown by a lawnmower.</li>
</ul>
That's a lot of negatives, but rock does have its place. It makes a great pathway or border along a driveway It can also define a space around trees and shrubs that are well established Many of us have it ingrained in our heads to use rock — but most landscape architects try to sell their clients on organic mulches.
<h2>Do I need weed barriers beneath the mulch?</h2>
I’ve seen landscapers nearly get into fistfights over this question.
<h3>Weed barriers</h3>
Weed barriers (Photo 4) are plastics or fabrics laid over the soil before the mulch is applied, to further suppress weeds and limit water evaporation Some landscapers prefer not to use a weed barrier; many praise the new fabrics; others remain fanatics for the old plastic weed barriers.

The problem? Over the years, dust, dirt, and decaying matter build up on top of weed barriers, forming a thin planting bed for weed seeds. Hardy weeds can eventually take root and grow right through fabrics.

Another negative is that weed barriers, particularly plastics, prevent the nutrients from decomposing mulches to work their way into the soil. They also take away flexibility; if you want to add or remove plants, you need to deal with the weed barrier beneath.

Following is an attempt to wade through the myths and mysteries:
<h3>Fabrics</h3>
Fabrics, or geotextiles, cost from 20¢ to 30¢ per sq. ft. and come in a variety of materials and weaves (Photo 4).

They all allow moisture, air, and varying amounts of nutrients to work their way into the soil, yet help prevent weeds from taking root or sprouting. (Note, even the best fabrics can't stop all weeds.)

Fabrics can be laid right up to the plant stems. and can be covered with either mulch or rock. Fabric clings to steep hills and rolling terrain better than plastic. too.

Make certain fabrics are covered with a 3 to 4-in. layer of mulch to help prevent seeds from reaching them. Mulch will also keep the fabrics from deteriorating by blocking the sun's ultraviolet rays.
<h3>Plastic</h3>
Plastic (around 10¢ per sq. ft.) is impenetrable to weeds — but it rejects rain, air, and nutrients with equal thoroughness.

This produces a Catch 22; the plastic needs to be perforated to let these elements through but in doing so provides a place for weeds to enter and germinate.

If you're going to use plastic, use black rather than clear plastic: it does a better job of keeping sunlight from reaching weed seeds and will last longer if exposed to sunlight. Purchase the 6-mil thickness.

Also. bear in mind:
<ul>
 	<li>Black plastic absorbs and holds heat, which can damage a plant and its root system — especially harmful to young plants. It can also promote shallow root growth.</li>
 	<li>Never use plastic under loose or organic mulch; it produces a slippery walking surface.</li>
 	<li>If you do use plastic, cut a 1- or 2-ft. dia. hole around the plant so it can receive plenty of moisture. Cover any plastic completely: sunlight will quickly deteriorate it.</li>
</ul>
There are situations where you may want to consider using plastic. If you have a wet basement, slope the soil away from the house, then cover it with plastic and rock to direct water away from the foundation.

Black plastic is also a good choice for rock gardens or for gardens containing well-established trees and shrubs.

A simple rule of thumb for using weed barriers might be, <strong>the more permanent the planting bed, the more you should consider using them</strong>.

Never use them in annual flower gardens; maybe use them in ornamental or perennial planting beds; strongly consider using them in beds with mature trees or shrubs — in areas where you don't want to spend any time pulling weeds.

<strong>Weed barriers come in many textures and materials. The woven fabric has a loose plastic weave on cue rim for strength and a fuzzy surface on the other to wick moisture down into the soil. The non-woven fabric has more of a felt-like texture. Black plastic (or in this case, black plastic with a white side for use under white decorative rock) is an effective weed barrier in certain situations.</strong>
<h2>A proper planting</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1510" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/marvelous-mulch-fig-a-mulching-a-plant-bed.jpg" alt="" width="691" height="575" />

There is no one-and-only way to prepare and mulch a planting bed, but here's one proven method:
<ol>
 	<li>Prepare the bed. Remove the sod, add black dirt if needed, loosen and prepare the soil. Slope beds away from the foundation at a rate of at least 1/4 in. per foot. Always start with as weed free a bed as possible. Pull up every weed you see — roots and all. Because weed seeds can lie dormant for years before springing to life. consider sprinkling a pre-emergent herbicide over the area to kill most weed seeds before they germinate.</li>
 	<li>Install the edging. This could be plastic, wood, modular concrete pieces, boulders – almost anything that will contain the mulch.</li>
 	<li>Place the plants (Photo 5). Plant as directed, fill around them with dirt, then soak thoroughly to make sure no air pockets are around the roots.</li>
 	<li>Clean the bed one final time and rake it smooth.</li>
 	<li>Install fabric or plastic if you choose (Photo 6). Overlap seams at least 6 in., so no bare spaces open up if the area settles. Overlap the material onto the edging. Fabric can directly contact plant stems and trucks.</li>
 	<li>Add the mulch or rock (Photo 8). Three or four inches is considered optimum. Don't skimp — or weed seeds are more likely to slip in, as well as water is more likely to evaporate.</li>
 	<li>Trim the fabric or plastic along the edge of the border (Photo 9).</li>
</ol>
Some people prefer to prepare and slope the bed, then lay down the landscape fabric, make slits, dig holes, and plant their greenery. This is a good method for a planting bed containing loads of smaller plants or perennial flowers, but it doesn't work as well for bigger shrubs where all the digging and jostling involved can damage the fabric and leave soil on top of it.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1505" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/marvelous-mulch-5-prepare-planting-bed.jpg" alt="" width="528" height="447" />

<strong>Prepare the planting bed. Slope the sail away from the foundation. Pick all weeds and grasses and apply a pre-emergent herbicide to kill roots in very weedy areas. Position shrubs according to how much space fully grown plants will eventually require.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1506" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/marvelous-mulch-6-install-weed-barrier.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="461" />

<strong>Install weed barrier by loosely laying fabric over plants, cutting an "X" through the fabric, then slipping it over the plants.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1507" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/marvelous-mulch-7-overlap-seams.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="461" />

<strong>Overlap seams by at least 6 in. and let fabric run well beyond edging or borders. Trim the excess after you place the mulch.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1508" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/marvelous-mulch-8-spread-mulch.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="447" />

<strong>Spread mulch over fabric to a depth at a or 4 in. Thin mulch to 2 in. around trunk and base of shrubs. Don’t let mulch come in contact with house siding — it could promote rot or insect damage.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1509" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/marvelous-mulch-9-trim-fabric.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="443" />

<strong>Trim fabric along the inside, upper edge of borders. Check annually to make certain the weed barrier fabric remains totally covered by mulch — direct sunlight will cause fabrics to deteriorate.</strong>
<h2>Costs and time</h2>
When you buy organic mulch or rock, you're usually paying very little for the product itself; it's packaging and shipping that’s costing you. You'll find local products much cheaper than those that have been trucked a-great distance.

Cypress bark is most reasonably priced in the South where it originates. Volcanic rock will be cheaper in its native Western states. Redwood chips will be cheapest on the West Coast.

You can buy mulch by either the bagful (usually 3 cu. ft.) or truckload, with substantial savings when you purchase large quantities. One cubic foot of mulch will cover 4 sq. ft. of planting bed. 3 in. thick; a cubic yard will cover 108 sq. ft. to a depth of 3 in.
<h2>Mulch Maintenance</h2>
Mulches and rock eliminate most maintenance chores, yet present a few of their own. In fall, leaves must be removed from the planting beds.

Shredded materials, because they interweave, are more resistant to being raked from the bed; wood chips or hulls tend more to tag along with the leaves. Blowers are an effective way to clean rock beds.

When you mow your lawn, direct grass clippings away from mulched beds —— especially those with an underlying weed barrier. Grass clippings rapidly decompose and form a weed planting bed on top of weed barriers: a real chore to correct with rock mulch.

In spring you can renew the depth and color of organic mulch by top-dressing your beds with 1/2 in. of fresh material. Occasionally during the growing season, fluff up your mulch with a pitchfork to reestablish air circulation.

Some mulches, particularly straw, sawdust, and wood shavings, can rob the soil of nitrogen as they decompose. If your plants appear yellow or stunted, you may need to add a high-nitrogen fertilizer.

Over time you’ll get a feel for how much weeding and watering your planting bed requires. When you do water mulched plants, stick the end of the hose down under the mulch and slowly, but thoroughly, soak the soil.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>How to Tile a Bathroom Floor and Walls</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nothing beats ceramic tile in the bathroom. Here’s how to install it.

Historians may argue whether it was the automobile or the computer, supermarkets or TV that most changed modern civilization, but for most homeowners, it was none of those—it was the tile bathroom. Sparkling, easy-to-clean, water resistant, hygienic and long-lasting, the tile bathroom was the final step in our long march away from the outhouse.

Well, okay, maybe I’m laying it on a bit thick, but it's no exaggeration that ceramic tile is almost perfect for bathroom floors and walls.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1522" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ceramic-tile-0.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="497" />

<strong>Setting the tile is also a great project to do yourself.</strong>

You’ll find it pleasant work—no screaming saws, no grunting under massive loads of lumber and no gagging from dangerous fumes. You don’t need any experience with tile, either, to do a first-class job—a beginner can do it. However, you do need to have enough patience to plan, plan, and plan some more, and then to work carefully. Laying tile isn’t difficult, but if you goof, you can’t paint over it or sand it smooth.
<h2>What I will (and won’t) talk about</h2>
This is a complete guide to tiling a simple bathroom I'll cover the basic tiling steps, the major snags you may run into, and I'll pay particular attention to the most critical part: planning the tile layout.

But there’s much more that I won’t cover in this story—borders, diagonal arrangements, shower floors, countertops, marble and primitive tiles, just for starters. You may also run into problems from severely out-of-square rooms or from hidden rot. If you need assistance, tile shops can be a great resource to help you.
<h2>Part I – Planning</h2>
<h3>Costs: time and dollars</h3>
Tiling takes time; count on at least a day or two to prepare the room, and anywhere from a day to a week for the tiling itself. Don't forget that you’ll be living without the bathroom during that time. Make other arrangements or you’ll have a mutiny on your hands.

If you’re like me, you’re probably thinking, “Okay, but how much is this wonderful tile bathroom going to set me back?”

Depending on how fancy your tile is, the answer is from $2 to $13 a square foot, including adhesive and grout. Cement backer board, which usually goes under the tile on the floor and around the tub, costs an additional $2 a square foot.
<h3>Tips on buying tile</h3>
I love home centers (which is good, considering I spend half my paycheck there), but when you're shopping for tile, go to a tile shop instead. They have a tremendous variety of tiles, they’ll usually lend you tile-cutting tools, and they‘re more likely to have salespeople who can help you with installation questions.

When you visit a tile shop, you'll be blown away by the choices: unglazed quarry tiles, little mosaic tiles, super-hard porcelain tiles, marble tiles, hand-painted decorative tiles and rustic hand-made tiles. Here I'll be installing the familiar glazed wall and floor tiles. Other tiles are installed in similar but not identical ways. Ask a salesperson at your tile shop for details.

Here are some buying tips:
<ul>
 	<li>Floor tiles differ from wall tiles — they're harder and less glazed. You can use floor tiles on walls, but not wall tiles on the floor — they're too slippery and too fragile.</li>
 	<li>Don't be limited to small tiles—especially on the floor. Large tiles look impressive, they're very quick to install, and there are fewer grout lines to mess with.</li>
 	<li>Don’t use floor tiles that are the same size as the wall tiles—it‘s hard to get the grout lines to line up where the wall meets the floor.</li>
 	<li>Check on the availability of “trim” These are the tiles with smooth edges that you use to finish off the edge of a tiled surface (see Fig, D and Photo 11). Bullnose tile (one smooth edge) is usually available, but double-bullnose (two smooth edges) may not be or may have to be specially ordered, Check this out before you order tile.</li>
 	<li>Buy a threshold for the doorway (see Photo 14), Forget about the old-fashioned marble ones, which require a wet saw, and buy a Corian threshold instead. You can cut it with a hacksaw.</li>
 	<li>When you go shopping, take along a measured drawing of each surface you want to tile. The tile shop salesperson can tell you what trim tiles you’ll need, and help you estimate quantities. Don’t worry about ordering more than you need; most tile shops will allow you to return unused tile, and it’s a smart idea to keep a handful of tiles and some grout for any later repairs.</li>
 	<li>Tiles need spaces between them for the grout. Some tiles have little lugs on the edges to keep them the right distance apart; others are mounted on mesh sheets, already spaced (Photo 5). For other tiles, use plastic spacers, as I did (Photo 6). These are available in different widths; wall tiles usually have 1/16-in. spaces, and floor tiles 3/16- to 1/4-in. spaces, depending on how big the tiles are.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Tile spacing can be done in several ways: by plastic spacers, by buying tiles mounted on a mash banking, or by buying tiles with small lugs along the edges.</strong>
<h3>Buying grout and adhesive</h3>
Besides tile, you’ll need to buy grout and adhesive.
<h4>Tile adhesive: latex-modified thin-set</h4>
Latex-modified thin-set is a cement product. rather like mortar, with a latex additive for greater flexibility and strength.

It's the best general-purpose adhesive: waterproof, gap-filling, strong under heavy traffic, and low-odor. It's the hands-down choice for floors that get wet and shower enclosures.

Thin-set comes as a powder that you mix with a latex additive. The mixture must be wet enough to stick to the tiles, but not so wet that it oozes up between the tiles as you push them down. Do a quick experiment: Spread a gob of adhesive on a scrap of plywood, push down a couple of tiles, and make sure they stick without adhesive coming up between them.
<h4>Tile adhesive: organic mastic</h4>
Organic mastic is your other adhesive choice: It's slightly cheaper, premixed, and gives you plenty of time to work. However, it isn’t waterproof, so don't use it for floors or shower walls; it can’t fill gaps larger than 1/4 in, and it has a strong odor.
<h4>Grout</h4>
Grout comes in two forms, sanded and unsanded.

Use sanded grout for grout lines larger than 1/8 in.; otherwise, use unsanded.

Like thin-set, grout is a powder that you mix with a latex additive. Grout comes in different colors, so you can make the grout lines less visible by matching the grout to the tiles, or more visible by choosing a contrasting color.

White grout on a floor will get dirty unless you use a penetrating alkaline sealer and reapply it as needed.
<h3>You’ll need special tile tools</h3>
You're in luck in this department—most specialized tiling tools can be rented from a rental outfit or borrowed from a tile shop. (See, those tile shops are great. aren't they?)

If you do have to buy a trowel. get a disposable one; you‘re not likely to need it more than once or twice in your lifetime.

Here are the tools you'll need:
<ul>
 	<li>A notched trowel or two for applying adhesive (Photo 8). The size of the notches determines how much adhesive goes on, and different-size tiles require different-size trowels. Ask your tile supplier what trowel to use with your tile. If you put cement board on the floor, you’ll need a 1/4-in. square-notch trowel for that adhesive.</li>
 	<li>A “grout float" (Photo 15). This trowel-like tool has a hard rubber edge that you use to spread the grout and push it firmly down into the grout spaces.</li>
 	<li>A tile cutter (Photo A). Used for cutting straight lines in tile.</li>
 	<li>Tile nippers (Photo B). These special pliers have hardened jaws for breaking off bits of tile.</li>
 	<li>A round-cornered sponge. which you can buy for $7. This is used for wiping off the grout.</li>
</ul>
You may need a rod saw ($7) for cutting curves in the tile (Photo C) or an undercut saw (Photo 2) for cutting the wooden trim around your door. For the latter, you can substitute a handsaw with a fairly flexible blade.

You'll also need a handful of normal carpenter‘s tools for tiling. like a level, chalk line and framing square, plus several specialized tiling tools.

Masking tape is handy to keep the occasional slippery wall tile from sliding down or to hold a soap dish in place.

Finally, don’t forget to have several buckets and plenty of rags on hand.
<h3>Tile needs a good base</h3>
Tile has absolutely no “give” to it, so it has to be mounted to a surface that will not budge. It can't be used as a quick fix for a weak or uneven surface; the underlying wall or floor must be stiff and strong, or the grout will crack and the tile may pop right off.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1542" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ceramic-tile-fig-a-tile-walls-and-floor.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="633" />

Drywall and plaster walls, if they’re hard and not coming apart, make good surfaces to tile, except around the tub. Even green, moisture-resistant drywall is not moisture resistant enough for around a shower enclosure.

These walls should be replaced with cement backer board. This is a sheet material, generally 1/2 in. thick, composed of concrete sandwiched between two layers of nylon mesh. You can buy it at home centers in various sheet sizes It is totally rot-proof.

Though it’s not essential, cement board is also the best floor material, because moisture often penetrates the floor around the base of the toilet and at the edges of the tub. If any of you are parents of young children, you know what I’m talking about.
<h3>Layout is everything</h3>
When you’ve got a sample of the tile you want to use, you should make a detailed layout sketch. Make one drawing for each surface you‘re going to tile that shows:
<ul>
 	<li>How many tiles go across and up and down. Don't forget to include the space for grout lines.</li>
 	<li>Where the cut tiles will be and approximately how large they'll be.</li>
 	<li>Where the bullnose tiles fit.</li>
 	<li>Where accessories like soap dishes will go.</li>
</ul>
I want you to be a detail maniac about this, okay? A real nut case. The layout is the key to successful tiling, and it's just plain impossible for you to spend too much time planning.

The safest method is to lay a row of tiles on the floor, with their spacers if necessary, and actually measure them to get the dimensions you need.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1543" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ceramic-tile-fig-b-best-layout.jpg" alt="" width="787" height="829" />

<strong>The drawings unlock the mystery of tile layout—the key to a well-tiled room.</strong>

Here's how to plan your layout:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Hide the cut tiles</strong>. Keep the cut tiles in the less visually prominent areas of the room, and use whole or almost whole tiles in the most prominent places (Fig. B). The cut tiles should go in the corners, behind the sink or toilet, at the ceiling, and at the base of walls. But don't end up with “slivers"—cut tiles that are less than about half a tile width.</li>
 	<li><strong>Avoid the slivers</strong>. You can avoid slivers by eliminating one whole tile and having a cut tile at each end (Fig. C). A cut tile at both sides is also a good approach if you want a more symmetrical appearance, for instance, on the wall behind the tub.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1544" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ceramic-tile-fig-c-avoiding-slivers.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="651" /></li>
 	<li><strong>Check for square and level</strong>. Your rows of tile must be level and straight up and down, even though your floor, tub, and walls may not be. Check with a framing square and level. If the surfaces are more than 3/ 8 in. out of square over 8 ft. you'll get noticeably angled cuts, which look awful. Try to lay out the tiles so the angled cuts are concealed, like under the sink or toilet, but if that won‘t work, consult a professional tile setter—there are fixes.</li>
 	<li><strong>Watch the tub</strong>. You should have full or nearly full tiles along the upper edge of the tub. But the tub may slope, so plan to use a full tile at its lowest point and to cut the rest of the first row. Be sure to leave 1/8 in. of space between the tub and the tiles. You’ll fill it with caulk later.</li>
 	<li><strong>Don't forget the trim</strong>. As you plan your layout, make sure you include the special edge tiles, called “trim,” especially if you have any outside corners. The two common forms of trim are single- and double-bullnose tiles, which are used as shown in Fig. D and Photo 11.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1545" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ceramic-tile-fig-d-trim.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="655" /></li>
 	<li><strong>Plan the corners</strong>. Remember, one wall will have tile going all the way into the corner, and the other wall will have tile that butts up to that tile. Plan the trim particularly carefully on outside corners, and make sure the horizontal grout lines are continuous as they go around the corner.</li>
 	<li><strong>Watch the doorway</strong>. When you tile a floor, do the area near the door last, so you don’t walk on the freshly laid tile. But if you plan a row of whole tiles along the wall near the door, you could find yourself needing to add a thin sliver of tile at that wall, right at the last minute, just because your grout lines were a bit narrow, or the room is out of square. So plan for a row of cut tiles along that wall. They should, however, be 2/3 to 3/4 of a full tile, because this is a visually prominent area. Be sure to plan the threshold in your layout (Photo 14).</li>
 	<li><strong>Plan for your accessories</strong>. If you're going to put in a soap dish, towel bar, grab bar or corner shelf, plan for it early. You may need to leave a couple of wall tiles off to make room for the soap dish, for instance, and it may also require cut tiles on either side. "Flatback" fixtures can be surface-mounted over the completed tile wall. When you buy your accessories, ask how they should be mounted.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Part II – Prepare the room</h2>
This project used cement board on the floor and around the shower walls to create a stiff and rot-proof surface to tile on.
<h3>Getting the room ready</h3>
With a detailed layout in hand, you’re ready to go:
<ol>
 	<li>Remove the sink, vanity, toilet, shower fixtures (but not the tub), and all furnishings.</li>
 	<li>Stuff rags in the waste pipes under the sink and toilet.</li>
 	<li>Use cardboard or a heavy drop-cloth to protect the tub from scratches, and to keep the drain from getting clogged with debris.</li>
 	<li>Rip off the old drywall or plaster around the tub, until you're down to bare studs, ready to receive cement board. If there's rotten insulation, get rid of it and staple up paper-faced fiberglass batts.</li>
 	<li>I know you’re probably dying to set tile, but now’s a great time to paint the ceiling, while the drips won‘t matter, and also to replace your tub and shower fixtures, while the walls are accessible.</li>
 	<li>If you're tiling any walls outside the tub area, you may have to work around an electrical outlet or switch. Although you can leave the lights on now when you actually start tiling. you must turn off the electricity to your bathroom at the main panel, so get some work lights ready.</li>
 	<li>On the floor, it’s best to tear up the old tile or vinyl flooring so you‘re down to the plywood subfloor.</li>
 	<li>However, if you have an old vinyl floor, it may contain asbestos, so have a piece tested, either by a state agency or a commercial testing firm. If it does have asbestos, leave it alone and cover it with the cement board.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Putting up cement board</h3>
Cement board is heavy. but otherwise easy to work with.

To cut it, score one side with a utility knife, deep enough to cut into the surface mesh. Then snap the sheet backward and it will break along the score mark.

To make a hole, score a circle, then pound it out with a hammer and trim the edges. You can also cut holes with a <a href=" http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/how-to-use-a-jigsaw/">jigsaw</a> and metal-cutting blade.

On the floor, glue 1/2-in. cement board to the underlying subfloor using latex-modified thin-set adhesive, spread with a 1/4-in. square-notch trowel (Photo 1), The rough side of the cement board should face out.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1523" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ceramic-tile-01-spread-adhesive.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="511" />

<strong>Spread thin-set tile adhesive on the floor with a notched trowel, then screw the cement board down with drywall screws. </strong>

Screw it down with 1-1/4 in. galvanized screws every 6 in. in all directions. Yeah, that’s right—it‘s a lot of screws. Don’t have the seams in the cement board line up with seams in your subfloor, and be sure to leave gaps between the sheets as shown in Fig. A.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1542" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ceramic-tile-fig-a-tile-walls-and-floor.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="633" />

At the doorway, cut the cement board so the threshold will fit properly The threshold should rest directly on the subfloor and its outer edge should be halfway under the door (see Photo 14).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1524" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ceramic-tile-02-cut-door-trim.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="507" />

<strong>Cut the door trim so the cement board and floor tile will tit underneath it. This is a special undercut saw, available at tile shops.</strong>

One place that’s often a pain in the kazoo to fit cement board is the toilet flange, that plate that goes around the waste pipe under the toilet (Fig. B). The cement board and tile should go <strong>under</strong> the edges of this flange, according to many building codes

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1543" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ceramic-tile-fig-b-best-layout.jpg" alt="" width="787" height="829" />

If you can get to it, cut the waste pipe and fit a new piece on so the flange will be higher, or hire a plumber to do this.

However, in some situations, it may be very difficult to get to the waste pipe. In that case, fit the cement board and tile up to the flange and use two wax rings when you reinstall the toilet. The lower ring should be one with a plastic horn; the upper one must be without You may need longer bolts to hold the toilet down too.

Install cement board around the tub and shower (Photo 3), using galvanized screws or roofing nails every 6 in. along the studs to attach the cement board to the walls.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1525" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ceramic-tile-03-nail-cement-board.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="508" />

<strong>Nail cement board around the tub with galvanized roofing nails or screws. You cut cement board like drywall, by storing it with a knife, then snapping it.</strong>

Leave a 1/ 4-in. gap between the tub and cement board. and fill it with adhesive when you apply the tiles.

Cover all seams in the cement board with self-adhesive fiberglass joint tape (Photo 4).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1526" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ceramic-tile-04-tape-joints.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="510" />

<strong>Tape the joints with self-adhesive fiberglass mesh tape, the same kind that’s used for drywall. When you tile, the tape will be covered with adhesive.</strong>
<h2>Part III – Tiling The Walls</h2>
<strong>With reference lines to serve as a guide, all that’s needed is to spread adhesive and set the tiles level.</strong>
<h3>The first step: reference lines</h3>
Begin with the back wall behind the tub. Your first step is to draw a pair of perpendicular reference lines, <a href=" http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/straight-square-plumb-and-level/">one level, the other plumb (straight up and down)</a>, that you can use to align your tile (Photo 7). These lines show where the edges of tiles should be.

Use a level to find the lowest point of the tub, and measure up a convenient number (about 2 ft. worth) of whole tiles, including spaces for the grout and a 1/8-in. space above the edge of the tub. Mark a level line through that point all the way around the wall of the tub enclosure (Photo 7).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1529" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ceramic-tile-07-mark-reference-lines.jpg" alt="" width="529" height="439" />

<strong>Mark reference lines, level, and plumb, to guide your tile placement. Cut tiles should go at the bottom and corner, following your layout. </strong>

Then use your level to mark another line, this time plumb (up and down) and going from tub to ceiling. You'll need to measure out from the corner a convenient number of whole files, including grout lines, plus the width of the cut tile in the corner. Your layout drawing will show how large the cut tiles in the corner need to be (see Fig. B). Mark similar plumb reference lines on each wall.

After you’ve drawn the reference lines, double-check your layout and lines. Take a break—it’s time to lay tile.
<h3>Spreading adhesive</h3>
Mix your adhesive to the consistency of mayonnaise, then spread a few square feet of it on the lower corner of the back wall of the tub (Photo 8).

Don't cover up your reference lines. Spread the adhesive thickly at first, pushing it hard against the wall, then “comb” it with the notched edge of the trowel. This will leave smooth ridges of adhesive.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1530" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ceramic-tile-08-apply-adhesive.jpg" alt="" width="628" height="505" />

<strong>Apply adhesive with a V-notched trowel, doing only about a square yard at a time. Don’t cover up your reference lines.</strong>

If, as you’re laying file, the adhesive starts to get a skin on it or you feel it getting stiff, it’s starting to set up. Scrape it off, apply new adhesive and work on a smaller area next time.
<h3>Laying the wall tile</h3>
Work with whole, uncut tiles first, and press them firmly into the adhesive, making sure they’re lined up with your reference lines. If you’re using plastic spacers, use one at each corner. The tiles should look straight. level and equally spaced.

Avoid sliding the tiles into place, because this will scrape adhesive from underneath the tile, and check that adhesive is not oozing up between the tiles. If it is, scrape or wipe the adhesive out, or if necessary, use less adhesive or a less soupy mixture.

You’ll need to cut the tiles in the row near the corner and probably in the row above the tub, as well. See “Cutting Tile” below. Keep the bottom row of tiles 1/8 in, away from the tub.

When all the tiles are installed in the first square where you spread adhesive, move sideways and do another square. Gradually work your way up. one square at a time.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1531" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ceramic-tile-09-set-the-tiles.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="513" />

<strong>Set the tiles so they follow your reference lines. I used plastic spacers to keep the spacing uniform. Do the rut tiles in the earner lost.</strong>

As you move up, you'll run into the plumbing pipes. Here’s what to do:
<ul>
 	<li>Set all the whole, uncut tiles that fit around the pipes.</li>
 	<li>Then cut tiles to fit around them.</li>
 	<li>If a pipe ends up in the middle of a tile. cut the tile into two rectangles and nip out a semicircular hole in the edge of each.</li>
 	<li>Then reassemble the two parts, leaving a grout space.</li>
 	<li>Don’t be fanatical about getting the tile right against the pipe; within 1/4 in. is fine.</li>
 	<li><strong>TIP</strong>: You may also be able to rent or borrow a carbide-tip hole saw for drilling a hole in the tile. Ask at the tile shop.</li>
</ul>
If you're tiling more walls than those around the tub, you may have to tile around an outlet or switch.
<ul>
 	<li>First, turn off the power at your main panel.</li>
 	<li>Remove the screws that attach the switch or outlet to the electrical box, then pull it out of the box.</li>
 	<li>Set the tile to within 1/8 in. of the box, then replace the switch or outlet so the metal tabs on the end of it rest on top of the tile.</li>
 	<li>You may have to buy longer screws.</li>
</ul>
Once all the tiles are installed, gently level them by tapping with a hammer and a wood block (Photo 10). A bit of blanket or firm carpet on the block makes this a bit easier on the ears.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1532" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ceramic-tile-10-level.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="511" />

<strong>Level the tiles by tapping them with a piece of padded wood and a hammer, after you’ve done several square yards.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1533" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ceramic-tile-11-set-trim.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="514" />

<strong>Set trim tile around the edges of the tiled surface. Single-bullnose files go on edges; double-bullnose tiles go on outside corners.</strong>
<h3>Cutting Tile</h3>
Cutting tile is a snap—literally. It’s brittle, so the fastest way to cut it is to break it.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1539" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ceramic-tile-a-tile-cutter.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="473" />

For straight cuts, use a tile cutter (Photo A). It has a hardened wheel that scores the glazed surface of the tile. When you push down on the handle, the tile is clamped on either side of the score line and it snaps neatly in two. Most tile shops will lend you this tool if you’re buying tile. If the snapped edge is a bit rough, you can smooth it with a coarse sharpening stone.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1540" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ceramic-tile-b-tile-nipper.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="477" />

For curved cuts, like around plumbing pipes, use a nipper (Photo B). The nipper has hardened teeth, and as the name implies, you nip gradually away at the tile with it. It’s rather crude but fast and effective. The trick is not to take too much off at a time and use the corner of the jaws for more control.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1541" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ceramic-tile-c-rod-saw.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="472" />

For smoother cuts, use a rod saw (Photo C) for curved cuts, or a wet saw for straight cuts. The rod saw is a round carbide blade (it costs around $7) that fits in a hacksaw frame. It cuts slowly, but you can make nice, smooth curves if you need to, especially in softer wall tiles.

The wet saw is a diamond-tooth saw with a water cooling system; you can rent one for about $50 a day. It’ll make very smooth, straight cuts, and is especially good for L-shaped cuts and notches. It's also very safe—it cuts tile, but not flesh.

Caution: When you cut tile, sharp pieces will go flying. Please, wear your safety glasses.
<h2>Part IV – Laying Floor Tile</h2>
Floor tile is set much the same as wall tile: You mark reference lines, then working one small area at a time, you spread adhesive, apply whole tiles so they follow the lines, then set any cut tiles along the edges.

It’s more fun, though, because the larger floor tiles cover the surface quickly Most floor tiles require the use of plastic spacers for uniform grout lines.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1534" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ceramic-tile-12-mark-reference-line.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="477" />

<strong>Mark a reference line in front of the tub, and another line perpendicular to it. Lay the tiles out first without adhesive to double-check your layout.</strong>

Start near the tub, in the corner farthest from the door, and work your way to the door. If you need to cut the tiles that are directly in front of the tub, be very neat because this joint is painfully visible.

Don’t walk on the tiles until the adhesive sets, which usually takes about eight hours.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1535" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ceramic-tile-13-cut-to-fit.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="433" />

<strong>Cut tiles to fit around the toilet flange. The tiles should be flush with the flange and within 1/4 in. of it.</strong>

You'll need to nip tiles so they fit around the toilet flange (Photo 13), and cut them to fit around the threshold. Roughen the back of the threshold with 50-grit sandpaper, then glue it to the subfloor with thin-set mortar (Photo 14).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1536" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ceramic-tile-14-glue-threshold.jpg" alt="" width="596" height="441" />

<strong>Glue threshold directly to the subfloor, so it’s level with the tiles and its outer edge is halfway under the door.</strong>
<h2>Part V – Grouting</h2>
<strong>The final step – packing grout between the files and smoothing it out.</strong>

After the tile adhesive has set for 24 hours, you can grout the tiles. Stir up a batch of grout to about the consistency of peanut butter. using a latex additive instead of water.

Apply it with a float (Photo 15), doing a couple of square yards at a time. Use the edge of the float to firmly pack the grout down into the spaces.

Then scrape the excess grout off with the edge of the float, going diagonally to the grout lines to avoid digging it out of the spaces.

<strong>Apply grout in a diagonal motion, packing it firmly between the tiles. Go in the opposite direction to remove the excess grout and pack the grout lines further.</strong>

After packing the joints, wipe the tiles diagonally to the grout lines with a damp, round-cornered sponge, rinsing it frequently in a bucket of water (Photo 16).

The goal is to remove the grout from the flat surface of the tile and to produce smooth grout lines, slightly lower than the tiles. It‘s okay if there's a thin cloudy film left on the tiles. because you can buff it off later.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1538" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ceramic-tile-16-wipe-grout-diagonally.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="448" />

<strong>Wipe the grout with a round-cornered sponge, going diagonally. Finally, smooth the grout lines with the corner of the sponge.</strong>

Once the tiles look clean, shape the grout lines by making a light pass along the length of the grout line with a rounded corner of the sponge. Rinse the sponge after every pass. Allow 24 hours for the grout to harden.

After the grout has hardened, clean off the surface of the tiles with cheese cloth or a plastic scrub pad. If necessary, you can buy a solution for removing “grout haze” from your tile dealer.

By the way, if you're using two different-colored grouts on different surfaces, use masking tape to mask each area off as you apply the grout, and use a new sponge for each color.
<h2>Part VI – Final Touches</h2>
You're on the home stretch now!
<ul>
 	<li>Once the tiles are sparkling clean. you can reinstall the toilet. Be sure to use a new wax ring.</li>
 	<li>With an acrylic caulk, caulk all the joints where tiles meet the tub, around the base of the toilet, and around the plumbing pipes.</li>
 	<li>Reinstall the remaining faucets and other fixtures.</li>
 	<li>Rehang the door, and trim its bottom edge if necessary.</li>
</ul>
After two to three days, soak the grout with penetrating alkaline sealer to make it stain resistant. Check the label to be sure the sealer is the penetrating type, which lasts for a few years, not the silicone type, which wears off in months. Your tile dealer can help.

That's it — you're done.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you want to build an arched garden arbor, here are all the step-by-step instructions you’ll need — including how to avoid the few teensy mistakes that I made.
<h2>What’s it take to build?</h2>
Have you ever watched a sport like high diving, where the judges rate the dive by its degree of difficulty? Well, if I graded this arbor that way, I‘d have to give it a 5 out of 10 for difficulty, and a 3 out of 10 for size and time.

If you have some familiarity with power tools, this arbor should be fairly easy to build. It isn't large, and it doesn’t require a great deal of precision. There isn't even any concrete to fool around with. However, you do have to be able to use a circular saw, belt sander, and jigsaw. A couple of the parts are best made with either a table or miter saw.

Even experienced carpenters might scratch their heads for a while about how to build the arches on top of this arbor. So I've left nothing to chance, and I’ve described that part of the process in particular detail, including all the measurements you’ll need. You’ll find it the most rewarding — and most fun — part of the entire project.

The materials should cost under $270. And if you have an assistant to help hold the other end of things as you work, the whole project can be built in a weekend.
<h2>Choosing what wood to use</h2>
The classic arbor, the one that most people would think of if you asked them to imagine one, is painted white.

It's also the toughest to own, because of the scraping, sanding and repainting you have to do to keep the paint looking decent. It's especially hard to do this after your climbing plants have made themselves at home on the arbor.

If you want a white arbor with less maintenance, try using a white semi-transparent house stain. It eliminates sanding and scraping and is easier to apply.

You might also think about other colors besides white. Dark green looks particularly handsome. If you're going to paint or stain, you can build the arbor out of pressure-treated lumber. That’s what I did.

You can also build the arbor out of cedar, redwood, or cypress, which are naturally rot-resistant, and leave the wood unpainted. Left to themselves, these woods will gradually weather to a soft gray color, but by applying a preservative every year or two, you can keep much of the original color intact.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1557" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/garden-arbor-fig-a-plans-621x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="918" />

<strong>Fig. A – A Garden Arbor</strong>

When you’re at the lumberyard, choose the wood for the 2x2 rails (part B) with some care. Since the rails are attached only at the ends, any large knots will seriously weaken them. And you can bet that someday a kid is going to try to climb this arbor, rose thorns or not. I had better luck ripping long hits in half and buying a bit more than I needed. That way I could cut around the knots and pick out the best pieces.

If you're building your arbor out of cedar, some of the boards may be rough-sawn on one side. Don’t worry. You can hide all of those rough surfaces as you build.
<h2>Cutting List</h2>
[table id=28 responsive=collapse /]
<h2>Setting the Posts</h2>
Setting the posts isn’t hard, but if you've got helpers, now’s the time to call them. The first step is to determine where the arbor will go, by stretching four string lines (Fig. B).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1558" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/garden-arbor-fig-b-mark-corners.jpg" alt="" width="698" height="518" />

<strong>Four string lines mark the corners where the posts will go. Tie the strings to batter boards for easy adjustment, and use the 3-4-5 triangle method to test that the corners are square.</strong>

Use mason's twine (available at hardware stores), because it doesn’t stretch. Adjust the strings until they‘re the right distance apart and the corners they form are at 90 degrees.

Now use a posthole digger to dig four holes for the posts. Make sure the bottom of each hole is flat and solid dirt. Set a post in each hole, and tamp 6 to 8 in. of soil around the bottom of the post.

The best way to tamp is to pack down about an inch of dirt at a time, using a piece of pipe or a shovel handle. Start lightly, then as the dirt gets more packed, tamp harder and harder, on all sides of the post. As you tamp, use your level to be sure that the post is <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/straight-square-plumb-and-level/">plumb (vertical)</a> in both directions, and just touching the string lines on both sides.

When all four posts are tamped in place, trim the tops (Fig. C). Start by marking one of the posts at 76 in. above the ground. If your lawn isn’t flat, mark whichever post is on the highest spot. Then, using a straight board and a level, transfer that mark to the other three posts, so the marks are all on the same level. Trim the posts at that height, using either a circular saw or a handsaw and a couple of cutting guides (Fig C).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1559" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/garden-arbor-fig-c-trim-posts.jpg" alt="" width="694" height="907" />

<strong>Trim the posts so the tops are all at the same level. You can use a circular saw for this, or more lately, o handsaw and a couple of 2x4 cutting guides. </strong>

With the posts trimmed, cut the four cap blocks (D), center each one on its post, and screw it on. Use two screws, avoiding the center of the block. Now it's time to build the arches
<h2>The fun part: how to build an arbor arch</h2>
You can build the arches either outdoors or in the shop. Having done it in the shop, I recommend working outside — there are lots of scraps and sawdust. If you're working with pressure-treated lumber, be sure to wear a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/respirators/">dust mask</a> while you cut and sand.

The first step is to make a template for the arches, out of any kind of plywood you‘ve got kicking around (Fig. D) As you're marking the plywood for the arch shape, mark the center line on the top of the pattern.

Cut outside the lines you’ve drawn, so the template doesn’t get smaller than it should be. (I learned this the hard way.)

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1560" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/garden-arbor-fig-d-arch-template.jpg" alt="" width="555" height="533" />

<strong>Make a template for the arches out of scrap plywood. Rotate the wood strip with the pencil in it (the “trammel”) to mark the curves. Cut out the template with a jigsaw.</strong>

Next cut the small angled pieces (E) out of your 1x8 lumber. These get butted together to form the rough arch shape.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1556" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/garden-arbor-fig-a-one-layer-of-arch.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="313" />

Lay out four pieces on a flat surface, lay the template on top of them so one end of the template is flush with the end of one of the angled pieces, and mark the arch shape on the four pieces of wood (Fig. E).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1561" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/garden-arbor-fig-e-piece-together-one-layer.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="533" />

<strong>Piece together one layer of the arch, and mark all the pieces with your template. Cut them out with a jigsaw or band saw. Each arch has four layers.</strong>

Using a jigsaw or band saw, cut the shapes out, cutting on the outside of the lines. Mark all four pieces with a number so they stay together.

Now do another four pieces, only this time make the other end of the template flush with the end of the wood piece. This will ensure that, as you stack up the four layers of wood that make up the arch, the joints will be staggered. This makes the arch stronger.

Continue in this fashion until you’ve cut out all the arch pieces, marking ones from the same layer so they stay together.

Assemble the arches one layer at a time, screwing the layers together as shown in Fig. F.

For extra longevity, especially with cedar or redwood, you can glue the layers together, too. Use a resorcinol glue or construction adhesive. It’s not a big deal, though—the arch is plenty strong with just screws.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1562" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/garden-arbor-fig-f-assemble-arch.jpg" alt="" width="623" height="533" />

<strong>Assemble the arch screwing each layer to the next. You can also use a waterproof glue for added longevity. Stagger the joints as shown.</strong>

If you have one layer that looks particularly good, place it at the bottom of the stack as you screw the arch together, so you won’t have screw heads showing, This good layer. the “show” side, will face out.

When both arches are assembled and the glue is dry, clamp them together and sand the edges with a belt sander (Fig. G). The outside edges are straightforward, but on the inside, you'll have to sand across the grain so the sander will fit. Sand or cut the ends of the arches while they're both clamped together, so they're exactly the same size. Using your template, mark the center line on each arch.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1563" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/garden-arbor-fig-g-sand-completed-arches.jpg" alt="" width="666" height="829" />

<strong>Sand the completed arches while they’re clamped together, so they’re exactly the same. You can go across the grain with the belt sander to even up the layers.</strong>
<h2>Cutting the rails</h2>
Now cut the rails (B) to length.

A good way to do this is to cut the rails roughly to size with your circular saw, then line them up on top of a pair of sawhorses or a bench.

Clamp the rails together with a pair of pipe clamps, then saw all the ends at once with a circular saw (Fig. H).

Give the ends a touch with the belt sander while you've got them all together.

Since the ends of the rails must be predrilled for the screws that hold them down (Fig. A), you can mark them all for drilling at the same time, too.

When all the rails are cut and drilled, file and sand the sharp edges.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1564" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/garden-arbor-fig-h-cut-rails.jpg" alt="" width="742" height="813" />

<strong>Cut angled ends on the rails by clamping them together and cutting a bunch at the same time. Predrill for screws and screw the rails to the arches and posts.</strong>
<h2>Attaching the arches to the posts</h2>
This is a slick system to make it easy for you to attach the arches to the tops of the posts.

Drill holes, as shown in Fig. A, in the ends of the arches and the center of the blocks on top of the posts.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1555" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/garden-arbor-fig-a-detail-1.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="474" />

Drive galvanized pipe nipples (short threaded lengths of pipe) into these holes, and push the arches down on top of the posts (Fig. J).

If the arch doesn’t slide over the nipple easily, you can wiggle the posts (that’s why they’re only partially set), or screw a block to the curved surface of the arch and pound on it.

If these methods fail, just enlarge the hole a bit.

To keep the arch securely in place, drive a pair of screws from below, through the cap block into the arch. Predrill to prevent splitting,

With the arches attached, fill the rest of the postholes with tamped dirt.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1565" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/garden-arbor-fig-j-attach-arches.jpg" alt="" width="712" height="722" />

<strong>Attach the arches to the posts with short pieces of galvanized pipe (called “nipples”) and a couple of screws driven in at an angle from below. Add trim pieces to the bottom of the posts, apply a finish, and you’re done!</strong>
<h2>Attaching the rails and trim</h2>
Screw the first rail to the arches directly over the center lines.

Then measure down from it on either side, marking where the bottom edge of each of the remaining rails should go.

You may find a cloth or narrow metal tape measure the easiest way to work on the curved surface of the arch.

Screw all the remaining rails to the arches and posts.

Finally, add the trim pieces (C) to the base of each post.

Rip the bevel on the top edge of the board first, then cut a couple of test pieces to see how they fit around the post.

Once they’re right, cut the rest of the trim pieces and attach.

Give the arbor whatever finish you’ve decided on, and you’re ready to start setting out some plants!
<h2>What plants to grow on it</h2>
This arbor is designed mainly for heavier clinging plants like roses, wisteria, ivy, grapes, and honeysuckle.

Lighter plants like clematis and morning glory need more closely-spaced support. This design could easily be modified for such plants by stretching stainless steel or galvanized wires vertically across the rails, or by adding vertical 2x2 pickets on the inside of the rails.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Come spring, do you join the army of <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/">DIYers</a> who march down the aisles of the paint store trying to find that magical paint that'll last forever? Spring painting chores pop up like dandelions — if it's not faded or flaking siding, it’s a peeling porch floor. Or the walls in the kid’s room look shabby and worn from washing off marker stains. So we line up at the paint store hoping for a permanent fix.

Unfortunately, there's no magic formula. No one paint will do it all. So you can expect any paint store clerk worth his or her dropcloth to open the conversation by asking, “What do you want to use the paint for?"

Paint is a specialty product. The economical wall paint that looks great inside won’t survive long under the rigors of the weather outside. And exterior paints, durable as they are, can't withstand the wear of foot traffic if spread on the floor. The can you pull off the shelf performs best only when you use it for its intended purpose.

In this article, you’ll learn the various requirements of household painting, and then understand how the special paint formulations do the job.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1570" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/choosing-paint-fig-a-challenges-1024x639.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="348" />

<strong>Paints are specially formulated to resist adverse conditions like rain, sunlight, and foot traffic.</strong>
<h2>What’s in paint</h2>
Paint formulators, the folks who mix the paint at the factory. size up the conditions a paint batch must withstand (Fig. A above) and then juggle combinations of three ingredients — solvents, binders, and pigments—to come up with the best formula (Fig B below).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1571" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/choosing-paint-fig-b-comparing-ingredients.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="876" />

<strong>Different types of paint contain various proportions at solvent, pigment, and binder.</strong>
<h3>What are paint solvents?</h3>
They are paint components that make the paint go on smoothly, soak the surface and get a good grip and cover the previous color.

The two most common solvents are paint thinner (for oil-based paints) and water (for latex, or water-based, paints), though some types of paint use solvents like alcohol and lacquer thinner.

When the solvent evaporates, it leaves the binder and pigment behind in a smooth coat (Fig. C). Solvents are cheap.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1572" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/choosing-paint-fig-c-forming-film-493x1024.jpg" alt="" width="493" height="1024" />

<strong>To form a film, the solvent first evaporates, then the binder cures (hardens) and entraps the pigment.</strong>
<h3>What are paint binders?</h3>
Binders, on the other hand, are expensive.

They’re the glue that forms a durable film, entraps the pigment, and sticks to the surface. Binders are mostly resins like acrylic, alkyd, polyurethane, vinyl, and epoxy, and oils like linseed, soybean, and tung.

You're probably familiar with some of these names from trips to the paint store. They're the key ingredients that determine the character of paint.

As a solvent dries, the binders undergo a chemical reaction called “curing,” which lasts from several hours to several days, and produces the tough but flexible paint film.
<h3>Pigments</h3>
Pigments, of course, are finely ground particles that color the paint. They also affect its luster (gloss, semi-gloss, flat), extend the life of the film, and “fill” the paint so it covers more surface area.

Paints often contain several pigments, the more expensive, like titanium dioxide (white), for strong color, and cheaper ones like clay and silica (also white). to fill and extend the paint.
<h2>Choosing the right paint for the job</h2>
<h3>Exterior siding</h3>
Exterior paint has to be tough to protect wood siding from the weather.

It has to stop driving rain, which can penetrate and cause rot, and block sunlight, which can break down the wood fiber. Yet it also must remain flexible enough to stretch as the wood expands and contracts with wide temperature and humidity fluctuations.

And there's more. It must resist dirt, mildew, air pollution, and casual scrapes from ladders, tree branches, and misguided frisbees. All this without fading.

These are about the toughest demands you can make on a paint film, so paint formulators use premium resins and pigments in high-quality exterior paints (see Fig B).
<h4>How can I choose the best exterior paint?</h4>
A top-quality formula will use 100 percent acrylic resins for the binder in a water-based (latex) paint.

Specially formulated alkyd resins in oil-based paints work almost as well, but fewer painters use oil-based paints now.

Air-quality laws, which require reduced-levels of solvents (called “volatile organic compounds”), caused them to practically disappear from the shelves in some states.
<h4>Water-based or oil-based paints?</h4>
Water-based and oil-based paints each have advantages.

Oil-based alkyds brush on more smoothly than water-based acrylics and they dry harder, but acrylic films are more flexible and they “breathe,” that is, they allow water vapor to pass through so damp wood can dry out. That's a major advantage because it helps keep your paint from peeling. And acrylics don’t break down as easily under intense sunlight.

But oil-based alkyd <strong>primers</strong> still have some advantages, because bare wood absorbs oil-base solvents (like paint thinner) better than water.

A high-quality primer contains more binder and less pigment, like the gloss in Fig. B, so it adheres well and fills the pores in the bare wood. The topcoat then bonds to the primer and forms a strong, even film.

Many painters apply an oil-based primer to bare wood, then cover it with a water-based acrylic topcoat to form the protective film.
<h4>Can I put water-based paint over oil-based primer?</h4>
<strong>Yes, despite rumors to the contrary, you can put water-based paints over oil-based, but not oil-based over water-based for outdoor use.</strong>

Oil-based alkyds dry harder and don’t adhere well to the more flexible water-based acrylics when they expand and contract due to temperature and moisture changes. (indoors, either type will adhere to the other.)

Check with your paint dealer if you have any doubts.
<h3>Exterior trim</h3>
You can use the same binder-rich paints for trim as you do for exterior siding. Both must withstand weathering, but many people prefer to paint their trim with a semi-gloss or gloss luster rather than the flat you’d normally choose for siding (Fig. B).

Higher gloss makes the color brighter and, more important, in the case of oil-based alkyds, it doesn't chalk as easily. (See below for more information on Chalking.)

Paint companies and dealers often refer to gloss and semi-gloss paints as “enamels,” which loosely reflects their increased binder content.

As you might expect, the higher cost of exterior paints reflects greater resin content and costlier non-fading pigments. You’re not likely to find these paints priced low.

Of course, a high price doesn’t always reflect high-quality ingredients. That leaves the homeowner with a dilemma. How do you know what you’re getting?

Paint formulas, when they’re listed on the can, are too complicated to decipher. You really do have to rely on the integrity of regional and national brand names and the assurance of your local paint dealer.
<h4>What is paint chalking?</h4>
Chalking is the appearance of a light, powdery dust on the surface of the paint, which dulls the color. The chalk is mostly pigment left on the surface as the resin binders slowly break down and erode.

The chalk itself won't cause trouble unless rain washes a colored pigment down onto a different-colored siding or over bricks, staining them. Water-based acrylics generally don’t chalk, which is one of their advantages for exterior applications.
<h3>Are there good applications for inexpensive exterior paints?</h3>
When you paint a ham or other outbuilding, you don’t need a paint that looks great, just one that protects the wood.

For these paints, formulators use inexpensive oils like linseed oil for binders, and inexpensive pigments like iron oxide. Oils dry to a film slowly but remain flexible and durable.

The low cost of iron oxide, your basic rust, helps explain why most barns are red.
<h3>How can I paint wooden shingles and resawn wooden shingles</h3>
Rough surfaces exposed to weathering, especially wood shingle or shake siding, present another problem for paint films. (Shakes are thicker than shingles.)

These materials have more exposed surface, which gives rain more places to penetrate the wood. Wet wood will eventually cause even the best-quality paint to blister and peel.

Even worse, peeling paint on any rough-textured wood presents a difficult scraping job when you prepare it for repainting.

Water-based acrylic siding paints work better than oil-based paints on rough textures, because they “breathe,” allowing trapped water vapor to pass through them more easily.

They're also more flexible when humidity changes cause the wood to expand and contract. Make sure you prime bare wood first (as always) with an exterior primer to ensure good adhesion.

If you don’t want to risk peeling paint on a rough exterior surface, you might want to consider exterior stain as an alternative (Fig. B).

An exterior stain is a very thin paint, though it can be loaded with enough pigments to completely coat the wood (called a "solid" or “opaque” stain). It doesn’t contain enough binder to form a film, so it won‘t peel. And you won’t have to do as much prep work before recoating.

Stain doesn’t last quite as long as paint on rough surfaces, and it's not available in paint’s bright colors.
<h3>What is the best paint for porches and floors?</h3>
When trying to come up with a good paint for an exterior floor, you catch a paint formulator between a rock and a hard place.

Good exterior coatings must be flexible enough to withstand moisture and temperature changes, but on a floor, they have to be hard enough to withstand the scuffing and abrasion of foot traffic.

<strong>So porch and floor paints are resin-rich gloss paints (usually called enamels) sometimes made with harder resins. Water-based acrylic resins work well. Oil-base alkyd floor paints are often modified with even tougher resins like phenolics.</strong>

But any paint can have trouble adhering to a porch floor because water can sit on its surface for a long time, eventually soak through, and break the film’s bond to the wood.

For best results, be sure to apply an exterior primer first, or thin the first coat according to directions on the can.

Unfortunately, the gloss finish resulting from higher resin content can make wet painted floors slippery, so you might want to add fine sand to the paint to improve traction.

The air-quality laws that limit the solvent content of finishes posed an immediate problem for floor finishers who used polyurethane for a clear finish on interior hardwood floors.

Paint chemists quickly marketed a new line of water-based clear finishes that still contain such excellent abrasion-resistant resins as urethane. The best of these cost up to $80 per gallon, but they perform as well as or better than oil-based floor finishes.

We can expect this technology to expand into pigmented finishes, and you'll begin to see water-based paints containing some of the excellent resins once exclusively used in oil-based paints.
<h3>What is the best paint for concrete?</h3>
Concrete presents paint films with two challenges: moisture and alkali.
<h4>Humidity</h4>
Concrete is porous, so as everyone with a basement knows, moisture moves through it easily.

Moisture in concrete will break a paint film’s bond to the surface and cause it to peel. No paint system will adhere to damp concrete for long. If you want to paint it, you have to make sure the concrete remains dry

Water-based acrylic paints have an advantage here because they breathe and won’t trap moisture as readily as oil-based paints.
<h4>Alkali</h4>
Alkali is a corrosive substance present in all concrete, especially when newly poured. You can neutralize it, however, by washing the surfaces with a diluted solution of muriatic acid.

Wear goggles and rubber gloves when working with acids, even weak solutions like this.

In addition, for walls use a special water-based concrete primer, which contains PVA (polyvinyl acetate). PVA is actually the standard resin used in inexpensive latex paint. Most paint stores sell this primer.

PVA is too soft for concrete floors, so skip the primer on floors and apply two coats of water-based acrylic or an acrylic modified with epoxy resins. Epoxy resins deteriorate under intense sunlight but perform well indoors.
<h3>Interior Paints</h3>
Interior paints don't face the same rigors as outdoor paints, so paint formulators can make them from lower-cost resins and pigments. This is why you'll usually find interior paints priced lower than exterior paints.

Furthermore, most people prefer wall paints with a “flat” luster, that is, with no gloss. Flat finishes hide imperfections in the wall surface, while gloss paints highlight every irregularity. Flat paints contain less resin than gloss paints (Figs. B and D), making them even more economical.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1573" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/choosing-paint-fig-d-luster.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="941" />

<strong>The amount of pigment in paint usually determines the smoothness of the film surface.</strong>

Unfortunately, the rough surface that makes a paint film look “flat” also catches dirt, fingerprints, and streaks from every toy your kid bounces off it. And while almost all wall paints are washable, low-cost films quickly wash away, leaving you with a repainting job.

Truly washable paints must have a smoother surface, that is, contain more resin like a semi-gloss paint. Paint formulators found that they could make a smooth, washable surface without increasing the resins by adding different types of pigments (as fillers). These paints are called “eggshell” paints.
<h3>Painting metal</h3>
When you paint metal for outdoor use, you generally run afoul of two problems: making the paint stick and stopping corrosion. Unlike wood, which is porous, metal surfaces are smooth, even polished, so paint can’t get a good grip on the surface.

Paints stick better to metal if you roughen the metal surfaces and use special primers formulated to adhere to bare metal.

The second problem is stopping corrosion, especially from the water. Water causes metal surfaces to react, corrode and flake, breaking the paint bond and causing it to peel.

Special primers also help stop corrosion. Oil-based and other solvent-based paints perform well on metal because they form a watertight film and adhere well.

There are a few exceptions, however. Don't use an oil-based primer on galvanized steel. Paint your galvanized gutters and downspouts with a water-based primer designed for galvanized metal and then add an acrylic topcoat.

Proper prep work is critical here. Wipe all oil and grease from the surface, especially new surfaces, with a strong solvent like xylol (available from painting stores). Solvents like paint thinner and turpentine won‘t work, because they leave an oily residue.

Do your prep work outside where you won’t have to breathe concentrated fumes, and wear rubber gloves.

Paint won’t stick well to aluminum unless it’s chemically treated first (anodized). Consult a paint specialist for help on this one. On the other hand, aluminum siding already has a good, baked-on prime coat, so simply paint over it with an acrylic exterior paint.
<h2>Special problems</h2>
Some types of wood, when used outdoors, won’t hold paint well. Most hardwoods, like oak, maple and birch, fall into this category, but so does Southern yellow pine.

The darker grain lines in this pine species are dense and resinous. Paint doesn’t adhere well to the grain lines outdoors where the wood faces weathering. So builders often use this wood for porch ceilings and underneath overhangs, places where it won’t get wet.

Douglas fir plywood, the most common type of plywood, doesn’t hold paint well outdoors either, partly for the same reason.

In addition, the surface veneer contains many tiny surface cracks that quickly fracture the paint film. An exterior stain is often a better choice than paint. It won’t last as long, but you won’t have to scrape off a peeling paint film when you recoat the wood.

Redwood can also cause trouble. Its red heartwood contains natural tannins (acids) that can leach through paint and leave black stains on exterior siding, decks or fences. So when you paint redwood, use a primer specially formulated to block these stains.

Finally, hardboard exterior siding, often used over the last 25 years, will quickly deteriorate if water penetrates the paint film. Hardboard is made from compressed wood fiber and resins. If it’s not protected, the exposed fibers quickly soak up water, swell and further fracture the paint film.

The best solution is vigilance. Watch for swelling or signs of paint failure, especially at the bottom edges of boards and at joints. Then sand, prime with an oil-based primer and recoat them immediately with a high-quality acrylic topcoat.

		<title>Manual or Electric Staple Gun? Hammer Tacker? COMPLETE GUIDE + pics &amp; tips</title>
		<link>http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/staple-gun/</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2018 15:52:05 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In that long list of things you’ve got to do <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/">around the house</a>, there are bound to be a lot of things you could do faster and easier with a staple gun. Owning one or more variations of this simple and inexpensive tool can help you whittle away at that seemingly endless list.

Staple guns can fasten fabric, screen, insulation, carpet padding, cardboard, ceiling tile, paper, weather stripping, poster board, chicken wire, hardware cloth, roller shades, and much more.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1579" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/staple-gun.jpg" alt="" width="644" height="585" />

There are lots of different staplers you could own — from small office staplers to large pneumatic industrial models. Here I’ll focus on the three types generally used in home-related projects: the hand trigger gun, the electric gun, and the hammer tacker.
<h2>Hand trigger staple guns</h2>
They're versatile, they'll satisfy most of your home repair needs and they’re inexpensive — around $25 to $30.

Hand trigger guns are also surprisingly powerful. They make good use of all the hand and finger muscles to power a spring-release action.

The hand trigger gun is ideal for screen repair, roller shades, low-voltage speaker and phone wire (Photo 1), ceiling tile, and weather stripping because it leaves one hand free to hold or stretch the material you’re securing.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1580" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/staple-gun-1.jpg" alt="" width="537" height="349" />

<strong>Fasten speaker or phone wire with the hand trigger gun (but never electrical or extension wires). A free hand allows you to string out the low-voltage wire as you staple.</strong>

You need a solid work surface to get good staple penetration. If the surface gives, the gun won't set the staple flush.

If you do have a solid work surface and the staple still won‘t penetrate fully, use both hands, just as shown with the electric stapler in Photo 2 — or use the next shorter stapler.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1581" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/staple-gun-2.jpg" alt="" width="574" height="435" />

<strong>Hold the staple gun firmly, and gently squeeze the trigger. With a little practice, the spring-action hand trigger gun provides good accuracy and control.</strong>

Most hand trigger guns accept 1/4-, 5/16-, 3/8-, 1/2-, and 9/16-in. long staples.

A rule of thumb for staple length is that you need at least 3/16-in. penetration into the <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/new-hobby-woodworking/">wood</a> surface. If you're stapling thick or heavy material, use the longest staple that will sink flush with the material.
<h2>Electric staple guns</h2>
The electric staple gun does everything the hand trigger gun does, but faster, with more power and less hand, wrist and arm fatigue.

If you have lots of screens to repair or ceiling tile to install, this tool will save time and muscle. The electric gun uses the same staple sizes as the hand trigger gun, so you can use it on a wide variety of materials — from thin plastic sheets to 1/4-in. plywood.

It’s ideal for upholstery because its extra punch will drive staples into the hardwood frames of furniture.

Because it’s more powerful, the electric stapler has more kickback than the hand trigger gun, and usually requires a two-handed grip when stapling into oak or other hardwood.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1582" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/staple-gun-3.jpg" alt="" width="548" height="411" />

<strong>Stretch screening across the frame with the nose of the gun, pushing down and forward, and staple as you go. Push down firmly to prevent kickback.</strong>

Attach hardware cloth by centering the stapler on each grid pattern to avoid hitting tile wire and bending the staple.

A safety switch prevents accidental firing while handling the tool. The electric cord can be a pain if you’re working a long distance from an electrical source, in which case the hand trigger gun may be more convenient.

Most electric staplers cost from $40 to $50. Heavy-duty, industrial grade electric staplers and nailers are available, costing up to $300.

The largest of these will drive a 1-3/16 in. nail; they're useful for latticework, moldings, and cabinet assembly.
<h2>Hammer Tacker</h2>
The hammer tacker costs about the same as an electric stapler. This tool gives the most driving force of the three types. Its quick tacking ability is perfect for covering wide areas such as carpet padding (Photo 4), plastic vapor barriers (Photo 5), paper-backed insulation and roofing paper.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1583" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/staple-gun-4.jpg" alt="" width="424" height="396" />

<strong>Swing a hammer tacker with a quick motion to take advantage of its weight. The hammer tacker has the greatest driving force of the 3 staplers shown.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1584" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/staple-gun-5.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="605" />

<strong>Staple vapor barriers fast. The hammer tacker is speedy, but won’t work when precise staple location is required.</strong>

The hammer tacker works on a different principle from the others — the momentum of your swing drives the staple, so you can drive staples as fast as you can swing. Most hammer tackers will handle up to a 3/8-in. staple.

Accurate placement of the staple isn’t possible with this tool, so don’t expect to use it for detail work. And you need a couple of feet of swinging room, so it’s not usable in all locations.

A heavy-duty model is available for stapling down roofing shingles. It uses a heavier gauge staple up to 1 in. long.
<h2>Staple gun tips</h2>
If you’re stapling something to secure it temporarily, or if you staple something wrong, removing the staple is quick and easy with the right tool.

The tack and staple remover in Photo 6, along with needle-nose pliers, makes fast work of an otherwise tedious chore.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1585" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/staple-gun-6.jpg" alt="" width="582" height="488" />

<strong>Remove unwanted or temporary staples quickly and easily with a crowfoot task and staple remover.</strong>

The hand trigger gun and the electric model perform best when the rear of the gun is elevated slightly above the workpiece and a firm and steady pressure is exerted downward.

A little practice on scrap wood will give you a feel for how the tool operates, as well as its limitations. A few trial runs will also allow you to zero in on your target since you can't see exactly where the staple is going.

If you eventually plan to buy all three types of staplers, do a little research to make sure all of them will accept the same type of staple.

Some stapler manufacturers use staples that have a unique width or crown that fit only their own guns. Staple widths can also vary within a particular name brand. Avoid the clutter and confusion of having to buy and store several types of staples.
<h2>How do I clean and maintain a staple gun?</h2>
With proper care and maintenance, staplers last indefinitely.
<ul>
 	<li>Clean them occasionally by spraying them with a light oil and wiping with a clean cloth.</li>
 	<li>Don’t leave excess oil on the tool to gather dust and dirt, which could cause it to jam.</li>
 	<li>If your stapler does jam, carefully remove the crimped staple from the nose with small pliers; or if necessary, remove the magazine or head of the stapler to free the crimped staple.</li>
 	<li>Long-term moisture can be fatal to a stapler, so store it in a dry area.</li>
</ul>

		<title>How To Build A Custom Bookcase For Beginners (with plans and pictures)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You know how stuff piles up. Stacks of books and magazines grow taller, toys and games fill the corners. Tennis rackets, skates, tools and other equipment multiply with every new sport or hobby. And photos and other keepsakes you want to display have to jostle for viewing space on the overcrowded mantel.

To keep pace with the accumulation and to keep favorite items within easy reach, every homeowner needs a simple recipe for knocking together a batch of shelves at a moment’s notice.
<h2>Build them fancy, build them plain, the basic methods are the same!</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1595" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/simple-shelving.jpg" alt="" width="733" height="550" />

The design should be simple enough to produce sturdy shelving in a few hours, yet with a few variations and a bit more time, look attractive enough for use in a living area or dining room.

The design you’re about to see satisfies both requirements.

This design has eliminated complicated joints so even a novice can quickly nail together either heavy-duty utility shelving for the garage or good-looking bookcases for the family room, like the one in the opening photo.

In this article, you'll see the tools and techniques used to build this bookshelf. You won't need expensive power tools, only a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-circular-saw/">circular saw</a> and a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-drill-driver-kit/">cordless drill</a>.

If you’re experienced with these tools, you can build this shelving. And you'll see several special tools and accessories, all inexpensive that make the work even easier. The materials for this shelving cost $190.
<h2>Extra Shelf-Building Tips</h2>
There’s always more than one good way to build a shelf.

Since you'll want to adapt this design to your own special use, I'll present several alternative building techniques to give you more options. Use these tips to make your project stronger, more attractive, or less costly.

Finally, I've added five extra shelving designs at the end of this article to illustrate ways to alter this design while using the same basic building techniques. I hope they’ll stimulate your own imagination and creativity.
<h2>Planning your shelving</h2>
First and foremost, shelving is practical. The shape it takes depends on what goes on it and where you'll put it.

With this practical side in mind, let your imagination go to work. Pull out a pad of paper and a pencil and roughly sketch some designs in their room setting. Then use the following guidelines to help put dimensions on your plant.
<h3>Shelf Depth (front to back)</h3>
Plan the shelf depth (front to back) to fit the largest objects you'll want it to hold — books, photo albums, stereo with a turntable, toys, etc.

Below you’ll find some standard dimensions for various household objects, but don't hesitate to measure others, especially odd-sized things like the television.

These shelves were designed primarily for books of all sizes, and the 11-1/4 in. depth worked well for displaying photos, ceramic bowls, and flowers too.

Examine the alternative design illustrations at the end of this page to see how you can adapt shelf sizes for other purposes.
<h4>Standard Shelf Depths</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>CDs and DVDs: 6 in.</li>
 	<li>Paperbacks: 9 in.</li>
 	<li>Average books: 11 in.</li>
 	<li>Magazines: 11 in.</li>
 	<li>Display books: 11 to 14 in.</li>
 	<li>Record albums: 13 in.</li>
 	<li>Stereo equipment: 17 in.</li>
 	<li>Television: 24 in. -plus (measure yours)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Shelf Length (side to side)</h3>
Well-designed shelves won't sag. So when you plan their length, you'll want them to support the heaviest objects you‘re likely to set on them without causing them to dip noticeably.

While most shelves won’t have to hold a car engine, they should probably be strong enough to support a heavy load of books.

Using books as a standard, follow this rule of thumb: 3/4-in. thick wood shelves (10 to 12 in. deep) should span no more than 32 in. between supports.

I’m being a bit conservative here, lumping all wood species and plywood together. Stronger 3/4-in. boards like oak and maple can sometimes span another foot, depending on their quality. But not always. So generally, limit your shelf spans to 32 in.

You can make longer or stronger shelves in two ways:
<ol>
 	<li>by reinforcing 3/4-in. shelves with 1x2 strips glued and nailed to their front and/ or back edges; or</li>
 	<li>by using thicker wood.</li>
</ol>
<p class="box"><strong>Tip</strong>: Look for precut stair treads at the lumberyard. They're more than 1-in. thick and make strong shelves.</p>
I’m limiting the choice of shelving materials to 3/4-in. thick wood here (standard 1x8s, 1x10s, and 1x12s are all 3/4 in. thick). While many other materials work well, 3/4-in. wood is one of the best. Whether solid boards or plywood, it’s strong, easy to work with, economical in some grades, handsome in others, and available everywhere.

Since you can finish it in many ways, you can create an endless variety of shelving with it.
<h3>Shelf Height</h3>
You can build your shelving as high as you want, but remember that as it stretches higher, it has a greater chance of tipping over, should your athletic 3-year-old try to climb it.

Unless it has a wide. stable base, shelving that's over 3 ft. high should be screwed directly to the wall framing. You can always remove the screws when you want to move the shelves.
<h2>Choosing the Materials</h2>
With the dimensions of your shelving in mind, turn your attention to how you want the shelves to look.
<ul>
 	<li>Do you want to paint them to match the room?</li>
 	<li>Leave them natural?</li>
 	<li>Go for a rustic look?</li>
</ul>
What you decide here will determine which material you use. Use Table B below to help with your decision. It lists the advantages and disadvantages of common 3/4-in. materials and tells you how much each choice costs.
<h3>Types of 3/4-in. Shelving</h3>
[table id=30 responsive=collapse /]
<h3>Project details</h3>
These shelves were built into the family room as a permanent feature. The shelves were painted to match the woodwork and received a decorative oak top, stained to match the floor.

The project uses birch plywood for shelving because it provides a perfectly flat, smooth surface for painting at a moderate price.

However, choosing plywood rather than pine boards meant more time spent cutting out the right shelving widths. If you have a table saw, this task goes fast. But you don't need one to do a first-rate job, as you’ll see in the next section.

This project also used a solid oak board for the decorative top for three reasons:
<ul>
 	<li>First, the surface of solid wood looks more attractive than the veneered oak plywood. (You’ll find wide, solid hardwood boards, oak in this case, glued together from narrower boards to prevent warping.)</li>
 	<li>Second, it's easier to apply edge molding to solid wood, because you don't have to worry about ruining the thin veneer on plywood when you sand the molding joints smooth.</li>
 	<li>And third, this oak top cost $55, a $10 savings over oak plywood because it’d be necessary to buy an entire 4’x8’ sheet.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fig. A: Shelving Plans</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1619" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/simple-shelving-fig-a-shelving-plans-884x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="645" />
<h2>Cutting List</h2>
[table id=31 responsive=collapse /]
<h2>Cutting out the parts</h2>
Begin the project by cutting the plywood into properly sized parts.

This takes a little longer than if you use 1x12 boards, but plywood has some advantages. By using the factory edge as an 8-ft. saw guide, you can cut your shelving perfectly straight with a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-circular-saw/">circular saw</a> (Photo 1).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1596" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/simple-shelving-01-cut-boards.jpg" alt="" width="473" height="525" />

<strong>Cut shelving boards with your circular saw using a clamped piece of plywood as a guide. Wear eye and <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/hearing-protection/">ear protection</a> and work on the floor for more stability.</strong>

And by using a factory corner as a guide for crosscuts (when you cut the parts to length), you can cut off each piece perfectly square (Photo 4).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1599" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/simple-shelving-04-crosscut-guide.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="314" />

<strong>Clamp the factory corner of plywood for a perfect right-angle crosscut guide.</strong>

Unfortunately, the whole process can take quite a bit of time. It took me two hours to cut the pieces for our shelving.
<p class="box"><strong>Tip</strong>: Simplify your finish work by making smooth saw cuts every time. Use a sharp 40-tooth carbide blade to do this (Photo 2), rather than a 20- to 24-tooth standard blade, The 40-tooth blade is expensive ($40), so I keep mine stashed away, using it only on these occasions.</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1597" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/simple-shelving-02-measure-saw-base.jpg" alt="" width="318" height="280" />

<strong>Measure the distance between the edge of the base and the blade and adjust the plywood guide accordingly. Use a sharp, 40-tooth carbide blade for finer cuts.</strong>

I didn’t have an extra sheet of plywood to use as an 8-ft. guide, so I made one by cutting a 12-in. strip off one side of my birch plywood. (Later, when I wanted to use this guide for a shelf, I trimmed the edge straight, using the other factory edge as a guide.) Clamp the guide to the plywood sheet so the saw base slides along the factory edge (Photo 1).

The old saying “Measure twice and cut once” is good advice here. Slide your saw against the guide until the blade nicks the plywood. Then stop the saw and check your measurement to make sure the cut is exactly right.
<p class="box"><strong>Tip</strong>: if you set your saw blade to cut only 1 in. deep, you can saw right across the 2x4s that you set the plywood on.</p>
After cutting out the 11-1/4 in. boards, cut them to length. This operation, called crosscutting, presents an additional problem. The top surface of both plywood and solid wood tends to <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/can-you-cut-plywood-with-a-jigsaw/">splinter when you saw across the grain</a> (Photo 5).

If this edge will be visible, use a utility knife to make a 1/16-in. deep out along the cutoff line (Photo 3).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1598" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/simple-shelving-03-deeply-score.jpg" alt="" width="349" height="335" />

<strong>Deeply score crosscut lines on the top side with a utility knife to prevent splintering.</strong>

This time, use one factory corner of your plywood (which will be exactly a right angle) for a guide, clamping it so the long factory edge is even with one edge of the shelf. If you adjust the guide so the blade cuts just to the waste side of the line, you won’t splinter the wood, as shown in Photo 5.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1600" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/simple-shelving-05-scored-cut-vs-non-scored.jpg" alt="" width="365" height="284" />

<strong>The cleanly-cut veneer on the top piece was first scaled with a utility knife (along the cut line). The bottom piece, which was not scored, splintered when we sawed it.</strong>
<h2>Making adjustable shelves</h2>
Adjustability comes in mighty handy if you need to rearrange the shelves or decide to store some of those tall, coffee table books.

The simple shelf supports that fit in a 1/4-in. hole (Photo 8) are appealing because they’re unobtrusive. When the shelf is in place, you'll hardly notice them, although the vertical series of holes looks like the work of a very precise woodpecker. The subsection below shows two alternative support methods.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1603" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/simple-shelving-08-shelf-supports.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="330" />

<strong>Shelf supports: (A) European style (requires 5 mm <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/best-drill-bit-set/">metric drill bit</a>; (B) Angle style, available with plastic button or coating for glass shelves; the hole allows you to screw the shelf on tightly; (C) locking style (pin holds 3/4-in. shelf in place so it doesn’t wobble); (D) Spoon-shaped style.</strong>

Drilling all the holes gets boring – see what I did here?

Stupid puns apart, this is no time for carelessness. If all four holes that support a shelf don’t line up exactly, the shelf will have an annoying wobble.

The homemade jig in Photo 6 improves your accuracy and speeds up the job considerably. I made it from a piece of 1/4-in. plywood cut to exactly the shelving width.

I drilled the holes 1-1/4 in. in from each edge and 1-1/4 in. apart. After clamping and drilling one set of holes, you simply slid the jig up the board, aligned it by shoving a 1/4-in. dowel into the last hole drilled, and clamped and drilled again (Photo 6).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1601" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/simple-shelving-06-drill-support-holes.jpg" alt="" width="770" height="599" />

<strong>Drill support holes for adjustable shelves quickly with a 1/4-in plywood jig. Line it up with the sides, clamp it, drill, and move it up. A wood peg aligns the jig with the last hole drilled.</strong>

You could easily mess up the alignment if you begin the holes at different levels or flip the jig over, top to bottom when you switch to another board.

You won't discover your error until you reach the end of the project and install the shelves. So label the top and bottom of the jig and the workpieces, and measure the beginning point on each piece accurately.

Two tools are essential for drilling good holes:
<ul>
 	<li>A drill stop controls the hole depth and, more important, keeps your drill bit from breaking through the other side of the board, a minor disaster (Photo 7).</li>
 	<li>The other indispensable tool is a brad point drill bit, which cuts a cleaner hole than a regular twist bit, without chipping the edges of the hole.</li>
</ul>
<p class="box"><strong>Tip</strong>: In reality, a brad point bit doesn’t always cut a perfect hole. Experiment on a piece of scrap wood to find the combination of drill speed and pressure that yields the cleanest hole.</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1602" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/simple-shelving-07-brad-point-bit.jpg" alt="" width="353" height="280" />

<strong>A brad point bit cuts cleaner holes than a regular twist drill bit. The adjustable stop maintains the right hole depth.</strong>
<h3>Alternative shelf supports</h3>
Metal standards and wooden cleats are two practical alternatives to the hole-drilling support system.

The metal standards are the quickest and easiest system (Photo 12) and cost from $2 to $7 per strip. You can usually find them in gold, chrome and brown finishes.

Simply tack the strips to the shelving sides with special short nails and snap the adjustable clips into place. However, before you install them, stand them side by side on a flat surface to make sure the holes in the standards line up with each other. This avoids wobbly shelves later.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1607" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/simple-shelving-12-metal-standards.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="293" />

<strong>Metal standards (strips) and brackets are strong and easy to install.</strong>

Nailing or screwing a series of cleats to the sides of the shelving is the strongest system and is particularly useful for utility shelves, where appearance is less important (Photo 13).

Space the cleats so the shelves adjust easily. You can make them somewhat decorative by using a molding as shown in the photo below. However, mount the cleats at a perfect right angle to the front edge to prevent shelf wobble.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1608" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/simple-shelving-13-cleats.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="296" />

<strong>Cleats make the strongest supports. Nail or screw a wood strip to the side at a right angle to the front edge.</strong>
<h2>Assembling the frame</h2>
If you’ve cut all the pieces accurately, assembling the shelf frame is a pleasure. The trick is to work on a flat floor or table and recruit a helper to hold the boards.

Pros use long clamps to hold their joints, so they can work alone. But you probably won’t have clamps long enough for this project (I didn't), so nab one of your older kids to hold the sides exactly on your layout marks while you predrill holes (3/32 in.) through the sides (Photo 9).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1604" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/simple-shelving-09-begin-frame-assembly.jpg" alt="" width="725" height="524" />

<strong>Begin frame assembly by predrilling all four corners with a 3/32-in. bit. This is a two-person job.</strong>

Predrilling isn’t strictly necessary, especially with plywood, but I like to do it so the nail will drive perfectly straight and hit the center of the board on the other side. That way the nail is less likely to split the wood.
<p class="box"><strong>Tip</strong>: Draw a line with your framing square to mark the center of the joining board so you can drill your holes accurately (Photo 10). (I used a dark line so you could see it. Instead. draw a light pencil line so you can erase it later.)</p>

<h3>Time-out: screws or nails?</h3>
If you prefer, you can predrill and drive screws instead of nails, as shown in Photo 16. Screws hold better, but I chose nails for three reasons.
<ol>
 	<li>First, I’m really relying on the glue to make the joints strong.</li>
 	<li>Second, I’m going to anchor this shelving in one place. It won't be moved around, so it doesn’t need the extra strength offered by screws.</li>
 	<li>And third, screwheads leave big holes that are difficult to fill, while finish nails leave small holes. As you'll see later, I screwed braces to the shelf frame where the screwheads would be out of sight.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1627" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cordless-finish-nailer-dewalt-dc618k-xrp.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="520" />
<p class="box">If you can't rely on someone else to help you on this project, the best alternative is to buy a strap clamp (at least 20' long for this project; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NO6XHZC/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">this Bessey band clamp is 23'</a>) and a cordless finish nailer to make quick work out of the chore of hammering all these nails. All without a compressor hose and up to 5 nails per second such as the Dewalt pictured above. Save money and buy a tool of the same battery system you already own: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000MGNITW/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Dewalt</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EBC1MUE/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Porter-Cable</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019CU4MF2/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Ridgid</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NXKZ6US/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Ryobi</a> make excellent cordless finish nailers.</p>

<h2>Assembly continued</h2>
After predrilling all four sides, I spread yellow carpenter’s glue on each end of the horizontal frame pieces (Photo 10) and drove the nails home, punching them below the wood surface with a nail set (not shown). You'll need two sets of hands for this job, one to hold the boards in line and the other to drive the nails.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1605" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/simple-shelving-10-spread-glue.jpg" alt="" width="307" height="286" />

<strong>Spread glue evenly across the ends and nail all four corners. Wipe off excess glue with a screwdriver and damp cloth. Work quickly.</strong>

Work quickly. You don’t want the glue to set until you square the frame. The frame will be square when the diagonals are equal (Photo 11). Measure across each diagonal, then push the corners in or out until the two measurements are the same. Nail a temporary brace to the frame to keep it rigid and square (Photo 11).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1606" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/simple-shelving-11-square-frame.jpg" alt="" width="390" height="320" />

<strong>Square the frame by measuring across the two diagonals. Adjust the frame until they’re equal. Then tack on a temporary brace and let the glue dry.</strong>

At this point, let the glue dry for two hours. It's a good time to work on the shelf edges. Keep the temporary brace in place until you’ve completed all your work on the frame.

Next, prepare the center divider by cutting 3/4 x 4-in. notches with a jigsaw for the top and bottom braces (Photo 14). Predrill, glue, and nail the divider to the frame (Photo 15). You'll have to bow the top and bottom outward slightly to fit it in without smearing the glue.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1609" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/simple-shelving-14-cut-notches.jpg" alt="" width="351" height="371" />

<strong>Cut notches for the braces in the center section, using a jigsaw or handsaw.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1610" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/simple-shelving-15-glue-nail-center.jpg" alt="" width="401" height="365" />

<strong>Glue and nail the center section in place. Flex the top and bottom slightly outward to slip the section in without smearing the glue.</strong>

Finally glue and screw (1-3/4 in. No. 6 drywall screws) the top and bottom braces in place (Photo 16 and Fig A).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1611" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/simple-shelving-16-screw-backbraces.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="580" />

<strong>Screw the two back braces in place wherever the screw/heads won’t show. Drive 6d finish nails where the heads are visible. Nail on the front brace (Fig. A).</strong>

Predrilling with the countersink bit in Photo 17 makes quick, clean holes for the screws. The screwheads will fit flush with or slightly below the surface of the wood. Use 6d finish nails to fasten the ends of the braces to the sides of the frame, because the nailheads leave smaller holes than screws would in this highly visible area.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1594" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/countersink-drill-bit-set-snappy-5-piece.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="520" />
<p class="box">This Snappy drill bit set allows you to drill, countersink and counterbore holes in one easy operation. It has 5 sizes (#4, #6, #8, #10, or #12 screws) and it does cost more than other sets. However, it is made in America and it will also last longer than other cheap Chinese kits. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XXZME8/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Click here to buy it from Amazon.</a></p>
Plywood has one weakness that solid boards do not. Its edges look bad, and even a thick coat of paint can't hide the layered pattern. Obviously, on these shelves, you see a lot of those edges.

There’s a quick way to clean them up though — apply veneer edging. I used a thin birch veneer edging coated on one side with hot glue, which comes in a roll.

To apply the edging:
<ol>
 	<li>cut a piece to length,</li>
 	<li>hold it in place,</li>
 	<li>and run a hot iron over it to heat the glue (Photo 18),</li>
 	<li>then use a roller (a glass bottle or wood block works too) to press the edging down until the glue cools and hardens.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1613" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/simple-shelving-18-iron-on-veneer.jpg" alt="" width="551" height="495" /><strong>Use a hot iron to press the iron-on veneer onto all exposed plywood edges. Roll it down firmly as it cools.</strong>The veneer is 7/8 in. wide. so you have to use a file, sandpaper or a knife to trim the excess (Photo 19). Work carefully, especially if you plan to apply a natural or stained finish, so you don't cut through the thin surface veneer of the plywood.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1614" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/simple-shelving-19-file-veneer-flush.jpg" alt="" width="316" height="285" />

<strong>File the overlapping veneer flush with the plywood surfaces. Push the file, don’t pull, so you don’t chip the thin veneer.</strong>

Iron the veneer onto all the visible edges, including the shelves, so they’ll look identical to the sides when painted.
<h2>Installing the shelving</h2>
This bookcase was designed to fill a section of wall in a family room. To make it fit the room’s decor and look permanent, it was screwed to the wall, wrapped it with the base trim and fitted it with a decorative oak top.

Wrapping the trim around its base adds a touch of style to the bookcase and gives the bottom more visual “weight.” so it appears better-proportioned top to bottom

Plan this step in advance by making the bottom shelf 1/4 in. higher than your base trim (Fig. A). This 1/4-in. reveal nicely hides small height variations in the floor.

Begin installation by removing the base trim (Photo 20) so you can shove the shelving back against the wall.

If you're likely to damage the wall or create other hassles when pulling the base trim, cut it with a jigsaw or reciprocating saw and remove only the section covered by the shelving.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1615" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/simple-shelving-20-remove-base-trim.jpg" alt="" width="356" height="382" />

<strong>Remove the base trim to the shelving sits flush against the wall. Use a pry bar and block to protect the wall and trim so you can reuse it later.</strong>

Problem: While the new trim will cover this raggedly cut edge, we should warn you that the cut itself is not easy.
<p class="box"><strong>Tip</strong>: Another approach is to leave the base trim in place and notch the shelving sides (and bottom shelf) around it, fitting its profile. This wouldn't work for our project because one entire shelf side must fit into the corner of the wall.</p>
With the shelving tight against the wall, level it with shims and screw it to the wall through the braces. Put a few drops of glue on the shims after you cut them off with a utility knife so they won’t slip out later.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1616" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/simple-shelving-21-level-with-shims.jpg" alt="" width="421" height="471" />

<strong>Level the shelving with thin wood shims. Cut the shims off with a utility knife and glue them so they won’t slip out.</strong>

Then add the base, mitering (cutting 45-degree angles) the outside corner so it looks clean and sharp.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1617" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/simple-shelving-22-reinstall-base.jpg" alt="" width="719" height="488" />

<strong>Reinstall the base, wrapping it around the shelving. The old material won’t be long enough. You’ll need some additional trim.</strong>

Finally, assemble and fit the top. We bought a solid 3/4-in. oak board and tacked a 1-1/4 in. decorative oak molding (Fig. A) on its edge to make it look more massive. Before screwing it down, we added 1/2-in. spacers to raise it slightly and maintain the illusion of a thicker top.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1618" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/simple-shelving-23-assemble-oak-top.jpg" alt="" width="398" height="349" />

<strong>Assemble the oak top, stain it and apply a clear finish. Then screw it to the shelving from below, so the screws are hidden.</strong>

Building shelving to fit a certain spot calls for more exact planning, but the result is worth it.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Plumbing can be mysterious and complicated stuff — much of it, anyway. But happily, many of the plumbing problems that haunt every house are no big deal to fix, even if wrenches make you nervous.

The simple fixes shown here will help you solve seven small but nagging plumbing problems. Some take only five or ten minutes and require no tool more complicated than a pair of pliers or your own hand. One or two might take you an hour. None of them will get you in over your head.
<h2>How to fix a Slow-Flowing Faucet</h2>
When your kitchen or bathroom faucet just doesn’t deliver water like it used to, the problem may be right at the end of your faucet spout.

Most faucets have a small device called an aerator (Photo 1) that screws onto the end of the spout. Its job is to mix air with the water, providing an even. smooth. splash-free flow.

If the water delivery is just plain slow. or if the flow is erratic, remove the aerator and clean out any debris.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1654" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/7-basic-plumbing-fixes-1-remove-aerator.jpg" alt="" width="873" height="526" />

<strong>Remove the aerator from the faucet end by turning it clockwise. Flush away sediment and debris, using a sewing needle to clean crevices and small holes.</strong>

Most aerators can be removed by hand with a strong clockwise twist. A rubber glove can give you a better grip. But you may need the help of a pair of pliers. If you do use pliers. don't squeeze so hard that you dent the aerator. Also, use a strip of folded-up cloth or paper towel to avoid scratching it.

Some aerators, especially older ones, have lots of parts in them — perforated discs, washers, sometimes several round screens. Unscrew the aerator carefully so the parts don't all fall out and get jumbled. If they get mixed up, figuring out how they go back together could keep you scratching your head for a while.

First try flushing out any debris inside (mostly small iron, lime, and calcium particles) without taking all the internal parts out of the aerator. Then tap it sharply upside down on the counter.

If this doesn’t do the job, you’ll need to disassemble the internal parts, laying them out in the order you remove them (Photo 2).

The holes and crevices in the screens and discs are small, so you may need to use a sewing needle to pick and poke the particles out.

Once you have all the parts cleaned, reassemble the aerator, but don’t put it back on just yet. First run both hot and cold water to flush out any residue that may have collected behind the aerator, then reinstall the aerator.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1655" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/7-basic-plumbing-fixes-2-disassemble-aerator.jpg" alt="" width="423" height="352" />

<strong>Disassemble the aerator parts if further cleaning is necessary. Lay out the parts in order so you’ll remember how they go back together.</strong>

It the water still doesn’t flow smoothly and splash-free, the aerator parts themselves may be the problem. They may be worn or distorted.

Take the old aerator to a home center or plumbing supply store. Plumbing supply stores often have a better assortment of plumbing materials than home centers. Buy a replacement aerator that’s the same size and has the same type of threads as your old one – it shouldn’t cost you more than $5.

But you haven’t settled with these particles forever, you know. They’ll be back! Iron, lime, and calcium are suspended in almost all water supplies. These minerals aren’t unhealthy, but they cause grief in your faucets, so think of cleaning aerators as sort of a lifetime hobby

The sprayer on your kitchen sink can get plugged and uncooperative much the same way as a faucet aerator.

The sprayer head unscrews at its base. Pay attention to the washers; there’s a thick, hard one and a soft, thin one. When it’s time to reassemble the sprayer head to the base, make sure these washers are in proper sequence.

Use a needle to clean out any debris from around the nozzle and inside the connecting joint of the base, then reattach the head.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1656" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/7-basic-plumbing-fixes-3-unscrew-spayer-head.jpg" alt="" width="436" height="470" />

<strong>Unscrew the sprayer head and clean built-up deposits from the nozzle and hose connection. Keep washers in order. To remove the hose from the sprayer base, snap off the metal C-shaped ring with a small screwdriver.</strong>

If you can’t get the sprayer head cleaned out. or if it’s worn, broken, or just plain ugly, you can replace it.

The good news is that most brands of sprayer heads are interchangeable. Bring the old one along to a home center or plumbing supply store. The heads can often be purchased separately from the hose, and cost around $15.

If your sprayer head is good but the hose needs replacing, use a small screwdriver, as shown in Photo 3, to pry off the small, C-shaped metal ring that secures the bottom part of the sprayer head to the hose.

The other end of the hose connects to the underside of the faucet (Fig. A). Sometimes this hose connection piece is threaded on the outside, as shown, and sometimes on the inside.

Most hose replacement kits have adapters to accommodate either type of thread. but bring your old hose along anyway; it may save you a trip back to the store.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1663" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/7-basic-plumbing-fixes-fig-a-sprayer-hose-connection.jpg" alt="" width="651" height="424" />

<strong>Replace a sprayer hole by first disconnecting the hose from the sprayer base. Then unscrew the threaded fitting from the underside of the faucet base. Use thread faint sealant or Teflon thread-sealing tape on the new faucet connection.</strong>

Before you connect the hose end to the underside of the faucet. use your finger to dab thread joint sealant into the threads. A small tube of sealant costs about $3.

Clear out all the stuff under the kitchen sink to give you room to work when it’s time to connect the hose to the faucet bottom. Get yourself plenty of light and a piece of carpet to cushion your back against the edge of the kitchen cabinet base.

Since you're working in a small space, up high over your head, with very little leverage, pliers or an adjustable wrench about 6 in. long are the best tools to make this connection.
<h2>Fix a leaking basket strainer</h2>
A kitchen sink that won't stay filled with wash or rinse water is enough to make you growl, but it's a problem that's easy to solve.

The basket strainer that lifts in and out of the drain has two jobs — to strain the water as it goes down, catching any large items, and to plug the sink compartment when you want to fill it with water.

The stopper at the bottom of these basket strainers can wear out. If you’ve got one that won‘t hold water, take the culprit to a home center or plumbing supply store. It's important to get an exact match.

Fig. B shows the three most common basket strainers. The one on the top right has a dropdown rubber stopper; the one on the bottom right has a fixed stopper and a rigid, flat spindle on the bottom, and you turn the whole basket to seal the drain. The style shown at the lower left, usually the most expensive, has a threaded center piece that spins and locks the basket in place. A new basket will cost from $5 to $25.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1664" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/7-basic-plumbing-fixes-fig-b-replacement-basket-strainers.jpg" alt="" width="859" height="772" />

<strong>Replace a leaking basket strainer with a new one at the same type. The three main types are shown above. Each one seals the drain using a slightly different method.</strong>
<h2>How to fix a drippy shower head</h2>
A showerhead that squirts, drips or sprays you where you don’t want it to takes all the joy out of a good, hot shower. No need to put up with that.

A couple of good soaking sprays of ordinary supermarket delimer may clean out minor clogging, but if the shower head is worn or clogged beyond hope, replace it. A new shower head — even those muscle-relaxing ones with an adjustable or pulsating spray — is easy to install. They cost anywhere from $35 to $80.

The installation is super simple if you have external threads on the bottom end of the shower arm, as shown in Photo 4. Just remove the old head using long-handled adjustable pliers, then apply thread joint sealant or Teflon thread-sealing tape to the threads (wrap the tape on clockwise — the same direction the shower head screws on).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1657" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/7-basic-plumbing-fixes-4-remove-old-shower-head.jpg" alt="" width="527" height="418" />

<strong>Remove the old shower head from the shower arm. If the arm and has external threads, simply apply thread joint sealant or tape and screw the new head in place.</strong>

Screw the new head on by hand.

If the receiving collar (Photo 7) of the new head has sections of flat surface on it like a nut, tighten the collar with an adjustable wrench.

If the collar has either a smooth or serrated surface, carefully use a pair of pliers. Tighten the collar just enough so it doesn't leak. Remove any excess thread sealant or Teflon tape that remains visible.

If you remove your old showerhead and discover a ball-shape at the end of the shower arm. as shown in Photo 5, the arm itself, as well as the shower head, will have to be replaced.

This is a bit more work. but it’s no big deal. The cutaway wall in Photos 6 and 7 shows what’s going on behind the wall.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1658" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/7-basic-plumbing-fixes-5-install-new-shower-head.jpg" alt="" width="382" height="381" />

<strong>To install a new showerhead if your shower arm has a ball end, you’ll also need to replace the arm, as shown in the following cut-away photos.</strong>

Pull the cover plate away from the wall. With long-handled adjustable pliers, grasp the shower arm up close to the wall and turn it counterclockwise to remove it (Photo 6).

Take the old arm with you to a home center or plumbing supply store, and buy a new arm (it costs $10 or so) with external threads on both ends.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1659" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/7-basic-plumbing-fixes-6-unscrew-old-shower-arm.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="499" />

<strong>Unscrew the old shower arm by sliding hack the cover plate and using long-handled adjustable pliers. The wall cutaway shows how the arm unscrews from the shower supply pipe.</strong>

Carefully slide the cover plate onto the arm. put thread joint sealant or Teflon thread-sealing tape on the threads of one end and screw it in place (clockwise) as far as you can by hand.

Put your pliers on the arm up close to the wall and tighten to the desired position. The cover plate will conceal slight pliers marks.

Once the arm is in place. put thread sealant on the threads at the bottom end, and attach your new shower head as outlined above and shown in Photo 7.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1660" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/7-basic-plumbing-fixes-7-screw-new-shower-arm.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="355" />

<strong>Screw the new shower arm into the supply pipe and tighten. Then mount the new shower head to the arm bottom. Use pipe thread sealant or Teflon thread-sealing tape at both joints.</strong>
<h2>How to fix a slow-filling washing machine</h2>
Does your washing machine seem to take forever to fill up with water? Particles of dirt and sediment may be plugging the hoses where they screw onto the threaded connections at the back of the washing machine. These connections are marked “hot” and “cold” on the machine.

To clean these hose connections, close the two shutoff valves that supply the hot and cold water through the hoses to the machine. Unscrew the hoses from the machine. If they won't come off by hand. use a pair of pliers — but very carefully so you don't squeeze the hose end out of shape.

Some washing machines have internal filter screens just inside these hot and cold threaded connections on the machine. Clean these screens with a cotton swab or small brush.

In other cases, as we show in Photo 8, each hose end holds a removable dome-shaped screen, usually brass, that’s attached to a hose washer.

Clean the dome-shaped screens, or replace them if they’re corroded — they cost about $2 each at a home center. Check the hose end connections at the shutoff valves as well. They may also have screens that need cleaning.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1661" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/7-basic-plumbing-fixes-8-disconnect-hoses.jpg" alt="" width="589" height="441" />

<strong>Disconnect the hoses from the threaded intake fittings at the back of your washing machine and clean the dome-shaped filter screens. Buy new ones if they are corroded or broken.</strong>

Before you walk away. make sure you’ve reconnected the hoses properly — the hot water to the hot water connection on the machine, and the cold to the cold.
<h2>Fixing a Washing Machine Water Hammer Noise</h2>
Your washing machine has an electric valve that shuts off the water when it reaches the desired level in the tub. This valve shuts off so quickly and forcefully that it sometimes creates loud banging noises, known as “water hammer.”

Get rid of this annoyance by installing shock absorbers on the offending water lines (Photo 9). These shock absorbers have the necessary fittings built right into them to connect to the shutoff valves and hoses.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1662" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/7-basic-plumbing-fixes-9-install-shock-absorbers.jpg" alt="" width="502" height="571" />

<strong>Install noise-suppressing shock absorbers on your washing machine’s water intake hoses to eliminate the annoying “water hammer” noise. These units screw in place between the hue and shutoff valve.</strong>

Simply shut off the valves where the hoses connect. Unscrew your hoses (carefully use pliers if necessary), then screw on the shock absorbers and reattach the hoses. Make sure the washers that come with the hoses and shock absorbers are in place.

The shock absorbers have an expansion area to counteract the quick opening and closing of the machine's valve. You can buy them at most home centers or plumbing supply stores for $20 each.
<h2>How to Drain a Water Heater</h2>
If you’ve ever really read the instructions that come with your water heater (who even knows where they are?), you’ll discover the manufacturer recommends that you drain some water from the bottom of the tank periodically.

Those same rascals that clog aerators and washing machine lines — iron, lime, and calcium particles — can settle to the bottom of your water heater tank.

In some cases, the particle buildup can actually reduce the storage capacity of the tank and make it much less efficient. A gas water heater, with the burner at the bottom, has to heat through all of this buildup.

These particles can also adhere to the inside walls of the tank, creating an internal shelf, causing noisy rumbling sounds as the water sloshes around the shelf.

Particles lying on the bottom of the tank can also rub back and forth, wearing away the glass lining, exposing the steel to water, and causing rust-through.

All water heaters have a drain valve located near the bottom of the tank, about 5 or 6 in. from the floor. These valves have external threads on them, so you can connect an ordinary garden hose to drain the water into a floor drain, but you can drain the water directly into a small bucket or shallow pan as well.

<strong>Be careful: The water will be hot!</strong>

Don’t try draining the tank using the pressure relief valve (Fig. C). Since it is at or near the top of the tank, it won't remove any sediment.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1665" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/7-basic-plumbing-fixes-fig-c-water-heater-drain-valve-types.jpg" alt="" width="787" height="947" />

<strong>Flush mineral sediment from the bottom of your water heater tank periodically. Shown are the three most common drain valve types.</strong>

Water heater drain valves come in different shapes and styles, and you may not even recognize them as valves.

The standard-looking drain valve, shown in the top inset of Fig. C, is the most common variety. It has a round handle that you turn counterclockwise to open the valve. (Some have a straight lever instead of a round handle. Turn the lever 90 degrees to open the valve fully.)

The style shown in the center inset of Fig C doesn't look like a valve at all, but you can identify it by the external threads on the end of its central spout.

The valve is usually white plastic and round or hexagonal—about 3 in. in diameter. To open, turn the circular or hexagonal outside ring by hand, counterclockwise. The ring and spout will turn together as a unit. Don’t force it once it reaches its limit; it’s possible to unscrew it too far, removing it from its moorings. and all the water will pour out. Talk about a mess!

A third drain valve style you may have, shown at the bottom, isn't always easy to spot, because it’s located in a recess behind a small metal door on the water heater tank.

It’s not necessary to turn off the cold water into the tank or the fuel source to the water heater while you’re doing this draining process. Flush the tank for two to four minutes, with the water flowing as forcefully as the valve will allow so that it will siphon out the sediment.

To determine how regularly you should do this procedure, check your water heater’s instructions (lots of luck, by the way!). In most cases, once or twice a year is often enough. Although some water heater manufacturers recommend this operation as often as monthly if your water has a high mineral content and you don't have a water softener.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When it comes to understanding a drain, there's a lot more going on than meets the eye. At first, it seems childishly simple. A pipe from the sink leads down through an abrupt, U-shaped “squiggle” and disappears through the wall, presumably taking all the drain water and waste with it.

When I was 8, I figured that the “squiggle,” called a P-trap (Fig. A) was a special blessing for kids with slippery fingers. If I should accidentally drop my goldfish down the drain while cleaning the fishbowl, I'd find it in the trap swimming around, if not happily, at least alive. It was some relief to know that if my best marbles, the household silverware, or my Batman ring slipped down the drain, they wouldn't be lost. The trap was there to catch them.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1714" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/drains-1-how-p-trap-seals-drain.jpg" alt="" width="955" height="895" />

<strong>A plug of water remains in the low bend in the trap alter the sink drains, sealing the pipe and preventing potentially hazardous and foul-smelling sewer gases from entering the room. The vent prevents that water plug from being sucked out.</strong>

But my childhood notion about P-traps was mostly wrong. While they do catch some dropped treasures. That isn't their primary purpose. As simple as it looks, the P-trap is a sophisticated piece of drainage hardware. In fact, it took several generations of plumbers working through trial and error to perfect this device. In the remainder of this article, I’ll explain the critical role P-traps play in making our drain systems work.
<h2>The problem of bad odors</h2>
Draining the waste water from a sink was never particularly difficult: any downward sloping pipe would do. But doing it while keeping the smells of the sewer out of the house was the big hurdle. The same pipes that carried wastewater to the sewer system brought the stench and potentially lethal sewer gases (from rotting food, human waste, and other garbage) back into the house. For all practical purposes, bad smells kept the outhouse in business (and outdoors) well into this century.

Some early solutions simply weren’t practical. Several thousand years ago, Roman plumbers solved the problem for nobility by directing a steady stream of water through the indoor bathroom (they had two and three seaters even!). The stream was a flushing mechanism that washed the waste and smells away. Of course, this luxury required that you lived upstream. And you quickly became unpopular with the folks immediately downstream! So the idea never caught on.

When concern for better sanitation arose in England in the mid-1800s, inventors came up with many solutions for blocking sewer gas. Few solutions proved to be sanitary, but the “S-trap” stood above the rest (Fig. B). When you filled the low bend in the S-trap with water, it effectively plugged the pipe and prevented sewer gases from flowing back into the house.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1715" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/drains-2-s-trap.jpg" alt="" width="607" height="991" />

<strong>The S-trap, invented in the mid-1800s, was a big stride toward blocking sewer gases and allowing plumbing to come indoors. Unfortunately, the water seal was often sucked out by the draining water or by other waste that shared a common drainpipe.</strong>

While the theory was good, the S-trap didn’t work that well.

First of all, you couldn’t assume that it would fill automatically. Water rushing through the drainpipe created a suction that pulled most of the remaining water along with it. This suction, called “siphoning,” drew the water seal right on through the “S” bend in the pipe. So to restore the water seal, you had to remember to pour a little water down the drain after draining a sink or flushing a toilet to make sure the trap filled. You'd smell the problem if you forgot. Imagine parents sniffing the air and yelling at their kids to fill the trap!

(Is this where the expression “shut your trap” came from?)

The modern toilet works exactly on this S-trap principle. The drain in the ceramic bowl is molded in the shape of an S-trap. Once you flush the toilet, the siphoning action effectively sucks out all the waste. Then, while the tank refills, a small amount of water automatically refills the bowl and seals out the sewer gases.

Occasionally, an S-trap caused another problem called a “blow-out,” Blow-outs occurred when a charge of water (called a slug) came down a shared drainpipe (Fig. B). As the slug rapidly dropped, it compressed the air in the pipes below.

This sudden compression forced the water seal in the traps of connecting drains back up into their sinks. Then, once passed, the slug often created a suction that tended to siphon the water from traps as well.
<h2>The key invention</h2>
The solution to the siphoning problem came gradually through trial and error. Finally, a plumber, experimenting with vents in 1874, came up with the solution.

The trick to keeping the water plug in place was to equalize air pressures in the drain system. To do this, plumbers added an extra pipe to the trap that led to open air (Fig. C), a kind of pressure relief system.

They ran the pipe upward so drain water wouldn't fill and clog it, eventually running it through the roof so sewer gases wouldn't stink up the house The vent finally made plumbing a welcome feature inside the home and put the outhouse out of business.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1716" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/drains-3-s-trap-with-crown-vent.jpg" alt="" width="619" height="990" />

<strong>Adding a vent solved the problem of siphoning and kept the water seal in place in the S-trap. The vent tended to collect debris and plug up, however, so the vented S-trap, the standard of the early 1900s, was replaced by the P-trap.</strong>

Plumbers continued to improve the vent system, eventually developing a basic rule of plumbing: Every fixture must have a trap and every trap should have a vent.

As a result, the drain systems in our homes have about as many pipes extending upward toward fresh air as going down to drain waste.

You might never know it though because you can't see the vents unless you have a sink in an unfinished basement, where the vent is exposed as it goes up from the waste line. Otherwise, plumbers enclose the vents in the walls.

However, if you go outside and look up at your roof, you‘ll see one or more pipes, 2 to 4 in. in diameter, poking out. They might be partially or completely covered by metal flashing to prevent the root from leaking. At least one will be large, 3 to 4 in., called the main vent or “soil stack” because it usually vents a toilet and the main sewer leading away from your house.
<h2>From S-traps to P-traps</h2>
The S-trap represented state-of-the-art drain technology in the early 20th century. Browsing through the 1910 Sears Roebuck Home Builder's Catalog, I found the S-trap pictured on almost every sink (The Sears catalog sold every part you'd need for your home, and in fact, you could buy the precut home itself, ready to assemble!)

But over the next 25 years, the S-trap was gradually replaced by the “half S-trap" or what we now call the “P-trap," named because it sort of looks like the letter "P" lying on its side (Fig. A).

The weakness of the S-trap lays in its venting system (Fig, C). In theory, the vent worked well enough, supplying air to prevent siphoning.

But in practice, it sometimes failed.

Every time the water in a drain slowed, say because sludge temporarily clogged the waste line, water backed up into the vent pipe.

Though it soon drained out again, the wastewater left behind oil, grease, and other debris in the horizontal section of the vent pipe. After several years, this sludge often clogged the vent, blocked the airflow, and allowed siphoning to occur in the S-trap.

Again, by trial and error, plumbers learned that the vent had to run upward to a point above the spillover line on a sink before running horizontally, so debris wouldn’t collect in the vent pipe (Figs. A and C). Plumbing officials eventually put this requirement in the plumbing codes.

The P-trap solved these problems because plumbers no longer had to connect the vent directly to the trap. If you look at Fig. A, you can see that now plumbers install the vent some distance away, conveniently back in the wall where it's out of sight. From there the vent can run straight up, keeping it clog-free. Once the vent rises above the spill line of the fixture, it can run horizontally and join with other vents, eventually exiting through the roof.

But several problems persisted. To make the system work smoothly, plumbing engineers found that wastewater flowing between the trap and vent (in the “waste arm,” Fig. A) must move at the right speed. If it flows too slowly, it’ll leave debris behind, which will clog the pipe. But if the wastewater moves too fast, it'll tumble, fill the pipe, block the balancing air from the vent, and siphon the water from the trap.

As a result, plumbing codes regulate this section of drainpipe closely. It should drop between 1/8 and 1/4 in. per ft. and extend no more than 42 in. (in most cases, although this figure varies with the size of the pipe) before reaching the vent. This results in the most efficient flow without siphoning water from the trap.

The sanitary tee shown in Fig. A will help you get the right slope It’s designed so that if the vent and drain pipes are exactly plumb (straight up and down), the waste arm that attaches to it will slope 1/4 in. per ft.
<h2>Another old trap: the drum trap</h2>
You'll rarely find an S-trap anymore; most have been replaced. But you are likely to find “drum” traps connected to bathtub drains in older homes (Fig. D). They look like a 2-lb. coffee can, made from iron, lead or occasionally brass, with a screw top or bottom. Water from the tub enters near the bottom and exits near the top, so wastewater fills the trap and creates the water plug before flowing out. Sometimes the screw-off tops were chrome-plated and left exposed in the tile floor, so you could open the trap and clean it out.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1717" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/drains-4-unvented-drum-trap.jpg" alt="" width="624" height="821" />

<strong>Drum traps had to be cleaned regularly. Many had no vents, even as late as the 1950s in some cases. They were usually made from lead or cast iron. The brass style with copper pipe that is shown here is a bit unusual.</strong>

The water seal didn't siphon out as easily from drum traps, so plumbers didn't always vent them. This saved the hassle and expense of running extra pipe, although codes eventually required a vent on most drum traps too.

Unfortunately, drum traps caused drainage problems because debris settled and collected in the trap.

If you didn't clean them regularly, a chore that homeowners often ignored, they would solidly plug up.

And you can't run a plumbing "snake" (a flexible wire designed to go around curves in the pipe) down through a drum trap to unclog it, because it'll get stuck inside the drum itself. Or worse, the snake will pierce the soft sidewalls of a lead trap.

The problem of the drum trap highlights one important advantage of a P-trap (or even the old S-trap). It's self-cleaning. Each time you pull the plug on your drain, the wastewater scours it and washes debris away. In reality, P-traps rarely clog up. Toothpaste tube tops, goldfish, and even sand generally wash right through. Of course, toothbrushes and silverware that won’t go around the bend will clog it.

Fortunately, P-traps are easy to clean. You simply loosen the two large nuts on either end and pull it off. (Keep a bucket underneath to catch water!) It’s better to trap those big objects early, where they’re easily removed than to find them stuck in a bend of the drain system that is much harder to get at. And with the P-trap removed you can easily run a snake farther down the drain to break open other blockages.

P-traps don’t solve all drain problems. The waves of stuff that we intentionally or unintentionally put through our drains — hair, sticky bath gels and soaps, grease and oils, lint, earrings, and so on — all conspire to block them up. But coupled with vents, they do their main job well. They keep the bad odors out.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>My 550 sq. ft. patio cost me around $2,700 in materials and rental charges. I did all the work myself. My cost per square foot was $4.91. If I had hired someone to do it all, it'd cost me between $10 and $15 per square foot. Keep on reading to find out everything I learned in my patio project.</strong>
<h2>Build Your Own Dry-Laid Patio</h2>
A little ambition and a lot of muscle power will earn you this enduring dry-laid patio.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1737" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dry-laid-patios-and-paths-791x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="721" />

Whether it’s in the land of Oz or your own backyard, there’s something magical about a brick path — especially if it leads to a sunny, spacious patio.

Don’t get me wrong; there’s nothing magical about how patios get built. They take loads of energy and muscle power. They require careful planning from the first shovelful of dirt thrown to the last paver laid. But you’ll get what you work for: a beautiful, usable, outdoor space that will last a lifetime.

This patio is “dry-laid,” meaning there’s no wet concrete used, just precast concrete pavers laid on a bed of sand. Ours is a large ambitious project with curves, paths, and steps. We circled trees, looped around landscaping beds and linked together two decks.

Every patio is different — the one you build may be larger, smaller, squarer or rounder. The good news is, everything you need to know about building any dry-laid patio is right here on this article.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1738" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dry-laid-patios-and-paths-fig-a-overview-1024x566.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="308" />

<strong>Fig. A: Overview</strong>
<h2>Pavers: Beautiful, Versatile, Manageable</h2>
One of the beauties of pavers is that together they create a large, durable space, but individually they’re light-weight and easy to install. This gives DIYers the permanence of concrete without the special tools, know-how and “hurry-upness” that concrete requires. Plus, pavers have color. shape and pizzazz.

There's no doubt about the durability of concrete pavers. They’re often used in streets and industrial parking lots where heavy machinery cracks ordinary concrete slabs.

Pavers — small and independent — withstand abuse by flexing, rather than cracking, under pressure. They’re ideal for regions that go through freeze/thaw cycles, too; the individual pavers absorb heaving and movement without cracking. And it’s a lot easier to repair small areas in a dry-laid patio than with a slab.

The simple rectangular pavers used here can be laid in a variety of patterns (Fig. B). Other paver shapes are available: squares, zigzags, keyholes, even some that look like fancy floor tile. Shop around at home improvement and landscaping centers.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1739" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dry-laid-patios-and-paths-fig-b-paver-patterns-327x1024.jpg" alt="" width="327" height="1024" />

<strong>Fig. B: Paver Patterns</strong>

Pavers can be used for driveways, sidewalks, patios, garden paths, even porch floors.

As long as the underlying gravel and sand base is properly prepared, pavers can be used almost anywhere. In areas where vehicles will travel, the subbase (Fig. C) must be increased to at least 10 in.

<h2>The Best Design For You And Your Yard</h2>
Whether you’re a novice or experienced DIYer, you’ll find this project doable and satisfying. You’ll be limited more by your energy level and tree time than by the skills required.

A well-designed patio must take into account the terrain, landscape and the needs and pocketbook of your family. Not all yards are candidates for a patio. In uneven terrain, a raised deck – which can span hill and dale – might be the best option for outdoor space.

This patio needed to be tied with existing trees, planting beds and decks. Everything was measured and a small scale drawing of the home and existing landscape was made on paper (Fig. A).

We used a straight, 16-ft. 2x4 with a 4-ft. level on it and a tape measure to get a rough idea of how much the yard sloped (that was noted on the drawing, too).

Then all was needed was to lay tracing paper on top of the scale drawing and doodle a half-dozen patio designs. A consultation with a landscape designer provided the following helpful tips:
<ul>
 	<li>Patios must have a slight slope (1 in. for every 4 to 8 ft.) for proper drainage. If you don’t provide enough slope, rainwater will settle into low spots, eventually softening and washing out the sand and subbase materials beneath. A flat or poorly sloped patio could even direct water into your basement. Too much slope and you’ll feel you’re on a listing ship. Bear in mind you can build up low spots with an extra-thick layer of subbase.</li>
 	<li>Ask yourself how you’ll be using your patio. My expert recommended a minimum of 25 sq. ft. of patio per house occupant. He also added that a patio at least 16 ft. long in one direction is often the most functional. Plan for at least a 6x6-ft. area out of any traffic path for a dining table and chairs. Do you need space for a grill? Lounge chairs? A wading pool? Planters? Hopscotch? Sketch these on your tracing paper as you doodle.</li>
 	<li>In small areas, use simple pavers and patterns (like the running bond shown in Fig. B). In large areas, you can break up the expanse with a variety of patterns or dividing bands.</li>
 	<li>Curves add interest and grace to the patio — but also loads of cutting and extra work.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pavers, Materials, And Tools</h2>
I paid 80¢ each (a little over $3 per sq. ft.) for my 4 x 8-in. pavers. I purchased them from a landscape center, where they supplied me with brochures from the paver manufacturer and gave me lots of installation tips.

When ordering pavers, estimate the square footage of your patio, then add 5%. If you have a lot of curves, borders or half pavers — like this patio — order 10% extra. This allows for damaged pavers and provides extra ones for future repairs. The plastic edging cost $4.50 per ft; the 12-in. spikes to secure it cost 70¢ each.

I used “class 5” crushed limestone for building the subbase. Class 5, a grade of material commonly used for road beds, is widely available. It consists of 3/4-in. rock and smaller particles, which nest together firmly when compacted. When ordering, tell the quarry or trucking company you’ll be using the material for a patio subbase. If they don't have class 5 limestone they should be able to offer crushed gravel or another suitable substitute.

The class 5 used here cost around $140 (7 cubic yards at $10 per yard plus a $70 delivery charge). One cubic yard of class 5, when placed 4 in. deep will cover 81 sq. ft. If you need to build up an area, order more.

Coarse sand for leveling and bedding the pavers ran $25 a cubic yard, plus delivery. One yard of sand will provide a 1-in. base for about 300 sq. ft. of patio. Order a little extra for sweeping into the cracks when you finish – my patio consumed about four 5-gal. buckets of sand for this.

For tools, you’ll use everyday hammers, levels and tape measures, as well as big, oddball tools like a flat-plate vibrator and a masonry, saw that you'll need to rent ($70 to $80 each per day). With proper planning. you shouldn’t need to rent either tool for more than two whole or half days.

All the materials and rental charges for this project came to $2,700. That’s a lot! But when you consider the pros charge between $10 and $15 per sq. ft. when they supply and install pavers, you'll see you’re saving 1/2 to 2/3 the cost by doing it yourself.
<h2>Planning And Layout</h2>
The first thing you should think about is where the last paver you lay will wind up. Will your yard accommodate the slope and size of your patio? Will a square patio end in nice, full pavers or skinny little slivers?

With your graph paper plan in hand, lay down garden hose (Photo 1) and 2x4s to form an outline of your patio. Use your level and a straight 2x4 to double-check the lay of the land for proper slope.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1721" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dry-laid-patios-01-outline-perimeter.jpg" alt="" width="544" height="469" />

<strong>Outline the patio perimeter using a garden hose for curved areas and long 2x4s for straight sections.</strong>

Then spray-paint a line 8 in. outside the outline of your patio to act as a line for excavating. Strip away the sod at this point (Photo 2), so grass doesn’t get in the way of the guide strings you’ll soon be setting up.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1722" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dry-laid-patios-02-remove-sod.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="475" />

<strong>Remove sod in an area extending 8 in. beyond the boundaries of the patio. Spray paint indicates the excavation line.</strong>
<h2>Excavating The Site And Building The Base</h2>
This part of the project is the key to a successful (and long-lasting) patio.

Use the bottom of a door or a set of stairs abutting the patio area as the starting point for establishing the final height and slope of your patio. Your entire slab should slope away from the house at a rate of 1 in. every 4 to 8 in.

This slope may be one long decline or a slight dome-shape so water runs off in more than one direction.

Place one end of a long 2x4 at the bottom of the stairway or an inch below the door threshold, then level across to stakes driven at the perimeter of the patio and make a mark (Photo 3).

Make another mark the appropriate distance down the stake to indicate the slope. In this case, after making a level mark on our stake with a level and 12ft. 2x4, another mark was made 2 in. down to indicate a slope of 2 in. for that 12 ft. (1 in. for every 6 ft).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1723" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dry-laid-patios-03-use-level-2x4-stakes.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="442" />

<strong>Use a level, a 2x4, and stakes to determine the slope of the patio. A slope of 1 in. per 4 to 8 ft. away from your house is the ideal. Run stakes and a grid of string to mark the top of the finished patio, then excavate 7-1/2 in. below strings.</strong>

Make a gridwork of stakes and guide strings to indicate the finished height and slope of your patio, then excavate 7-1/2 in below these lines. This will provide room for a 4-in. subbase, the 1-in. sand base, and the 2-1/2 in. pavers themselves (4 + 1 + 2-1/2 = 7-1/2 in.). See Fig. C.

If the area is hilly, you'll need to go back and forth between excavating, leveling, and setting strings to get things right.

Soil conditions vary greatly across the country. If after digging 7-1/2 in. below your strings, you still find pockets of loose dirt or black soil, remove it or it will eventually settle, creating a wavy patio.

Next, bring in the subbase material. Bring the area up to a height of 3-1/2 in. below your guide strings (Photo 4). It should be at least 4 in deep in all places The subbase should extend 8 in. beyond the actual edge of the patio to provide room for the edging.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1724" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dry-laid-patios-04-spread-subbase.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="473" />

<strong>Spread Class 5 subbase to a depth of 4 in. over the entire patio area and 8 in. beyond. Measure down from the guide strings to establish a uniform height at subbase.</strong>

It’s possible you’ll need to build up an area to accommodate your patio. In such cases, remove the sod and loose soil, then build up the area with your subbase material. Building a 10- to 12-in. subbase is common; even 20 in. would not be unusual.

Compact the class 5 using a flat-plate vibrator (also known as a compactor) as shown in Photo 5. Go over the entire area twice.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1725" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dry-laid-patios-05-tamp-subbase.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="449" />

<strong>Tamp the subbase using a flat-plate vibrator (rented at $65 a day). Work in a circular motion and compact the area twice.</strong>
<h2>The Essential Edging</h2>
Edging is an absolute must for maintaining the integrity of your patio. Without solid edging, your sand base and pavers will separate and drift apart as rain, frost and foot traffic pound away.

I used plastic edging. Left uncut, it remains straight and rigid, but when it’s cut it can be bent to form curves. Secure the edging into the compacted subbase with 12-in. spikes (Photo 6).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dry-laid-patios-06-install-edging.jpg" alt="" width="735" height="498" />

<strong>Install the edging on the tamped subbase using 12-in. spikes. Cut the webbing on the edging’s backside to make it flex for curves.</strong>

I used landscape timbers for combination edging/steps in a sloped area of the yard (Photo 7). Crisscross corners and use double timbers on the front of steps (even though the lower one will be buried).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1727" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dry-laid-patios-07-install-landscape-timbers.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="392" />

<strong>Install landscape timbers for edging in areas where you need to change levels or step down. Be certain to overlap corners.</strong>

This lower timber prevents the subbase and sand from washing out. The tops of the timbers should be at the same height as the surface of the finished patio.
<h2>Spreading Sand</h2>
Sand provides the final base for your pavers. If this surface is uneven, the pavers on top will be, too.

Ideally, the sand should be 1 in. thick, but if it's a tad thicker or thinner in spots, that’s okay. What you want is a firm, flat surface for laying pavers.

Sand also locks the pavers in place. When you vibrate the pavers, they’ll bed themselves slightly into the sand.

If your patio is under 10 ft. wide, use a screed board with a 2-in. notch on the ends to ride along the edging to level the sand (similar to that in the first photo below).

On larger expanses, level long lengths of iron pipe in the sand 2 in. below your guide strings, then run your screed along the top of the pipes. (When you’re done with the pipe, remove it, then fill in the groove it leaves with sand). In many cases, you'll use a combination — a notched screed board riding along the edging on one end, with the other end of the screed running along the iron pipe (Photo 8).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1728" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dry-laid-patios-08-spread-and-level-sand.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="458" />

<strong>Spread ad level a 1-in. bed of sand over compacted subbase. Pipes provide a guide for dragging the 2x4 screed board across.</strong>

Whichever screeding method you use, roughly dump and level the sand over the compacted subbase, then fill in low spaces and rake away the excess sand as you drag your 2x4. Shuffle the screed lightly from side to side as you work. You're not compacting the sand, just creating a firm, solid bed.

Screed only as much sand as you can cover with pavers in one day. Screeded sand left any longer is guaranteed to be ruffled by wind, rain, kids or a stray cat thinking he's found the world’s biggest litter box.
<h2>Pave Away</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1729" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dry-laid-patios-09-install-pavers.jpg" alt="" width="551" height="425" />

<strong>Install the pavers starting along the longest, straightest edge. Border pavers provide a crisp finished edge, especially along curved portions of the patio.</strong>

You should now be standing before an expanse of sand that’s flat as a pancake (but slightly sloped). Take down the guide strings you used to determine height and slope and put up new stakes and strings to mark the lines for the pattern of your pavers (Photo 10).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1730" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dry-laid-patios-10-continue-laying-pavers.jpg" alt="" width="679" height="501" />

<strong>Continue laying pavers using a layout string to keep them in line as you work. Put a gap between pawn or lap them tighter to stay in line.</strong>

Stay along with your house or other long straight edge and lay down the border pavers. A border isn’t essential, but adds a crisp, finished look, especially along curves.

Then lay the rest of your pavers in your selected pattern Just lay the pavers in place — don’t bang on them or twist them.

Measure over to your string every few rows to make sure you're staying on track. You can leave a slight gap between pavers or tap them tighter together with a rubber mallet.

If you’ve taken the time to set things up right, laying the pavers goes amazingly fast. Many pavers have little nubs on the sides to serve as spacers. Don’t walk or kneel on the edge of the patio until after you’ve vibrated it; otherwise, these pavers can sink unevenly.

The pavers here were let run “wild” near the curved edges (Photo 11).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1731" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dry-laid-patios-11-mark-pavers.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="443" />

<strong>Mark pavers that run “wild” into the border area. Then remove the paver, cut to size, and place back in position along with border paver.</strong>

Using a paver as a guide, I marked the inner pavers, removed and cut them on a masonry saw, then reinstalled the cut inner and the border pieces. On tight radius circles, we used half payers for the border (Photo 12) to avoid large, pie-shaped voids between them.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1732" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dry-laid-patios-12-use-half-pavers.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="445" />

<strong>Use half pavers for bordering tight circles. Smaller pavers cut down on the size of the pie-shaped gaps between each piece.</strong>

As big and foreign as the masonry cutting saw appears, it’s actually safe and easy to use. A constant stream of recirculating water keeps the blade cool and lubricated, and a sliding tray carries the paver past the blade. A cut takes about 10 seconds. Remember to wear your eye and <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/hearing-protection/">hearing protection</a>.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1733" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dry-laid-patios-13-masonry-saw.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="419" />

<strong>Cut pavers on a masonry saw. This saw has a built-in sliding carriage for moving pavers past the blade. The recirculating water keeps the blade cool and lubricated.</strong>

When all your pavers are cut and in place, vibrate the entire patio (Photo 14), starting at the outer edge and working inward in a circular motion.

The vibrator will lock the pavers into the sand and help even up the surface. Don't let the vibrator sit in one place too long, or pavers could settle unevenly or crack. Some pros place plywood down and vibrate on top of that to help distribute the weight of the machine.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1734" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dry-laid-patios-14-flat-plate-vibrator.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="469" />

<strong>Tamp the patio with a flat-plate vibrator after all the pavers an installed. Tamp the entire outside edge first, then circle in.</strong>

If a paver sinks deeper than its neighbors, use a pair of screwdrivers to pry it up, sprinkle a little extra sand in the void, then replace the paver.
<h2>Sweeping And Upkeep</h2>
Spread coarse sand across the surface of your patio. After the sand dries, sweep it around the patio (Photo 15) to fill the spaces between the payers.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1735" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dry-laid-patios-15-sweep-coarse-dry-sand.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="442" />

<strong>Sweep coarse, dry sand between cracks of pavers to lock them together and fill voids. Repeat with more dry sand in a few days.</strong>

Make sure the sand is dry — wet sand will bridge, rather than fill the gaps. It may take two sweepings with a push broom a few days apart to completely fill the gaps.

The sand helps solidify the pavers, and also fills any spaces where dirt might enter to provide a mini-planting bed for weeds.

Two coats of a water sealer were rolled over the completed patio. This wasn’t done to protect the pavers — they don't need protecting! The purpose was to enrich the color.

Landscape around your patio with grass, sod or planting beds to give it a finished look. Bring in the dirt to even out the space between the new patio and existing yard. Keep dirt at least 1/2 in. below any plastic edging to allow rainwater and runoff to easily drain away from the patio.

Set up your <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/adirondack-chair-plans/">Adirondack chair</a> and take a snooze – you've earned it!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1736" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dry-laid-patios-16-landscape.jpg" alt="" width="682" height="486" />

<strong>Landscape around the completed patio with flowers, shrubs, and grass. Grass will loot through the open spaces in flexible edging to anchor it in place.</strong>
<h2>Pathways</h2>
A pathway can be part of a larger project or a project in itself. A walkway made of pavers is an attractive way to link your driveway to your front door, existing deck to the new patio, or back door to garden area.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1741" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dry-laid-patios-pathway.jpg" alt="" width="732" height="626" />

Here are a few tips:
<ul>
 	<li>Keep the pattern simple; a border running parallel to the path with a simple staggered pattern within is often the most attractive.</li>
 	<li>Put a slight tilt in the path for drainage. One-half inch across a 3-ft. wide path is adequate.</li>
 	<li>Take extra care to keep the edgings an equal distance apart; it will make screeding, cutting and paver laying easier.</li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1742" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dry-laid-patios-pathway-1-smooth-and-level.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="469" />

<strong>Smooth and level the sand using a notched screed board riding along the edging for a guide. Include a slight tilt for good drainage.</strong>

<strong>Install the border, marking and cutting every other paver at an angle at curved areas.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1744" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dry-laid-patios-pathway-3-lay-pavers.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="456" />

<strong>Lay the pavers using a string for a guideline. Cut and Install pieces that butt up to the border later.</strong>
<h2>Shoveling Smarts</h2>
This project scores a 9.9 in sweat equity.

You'll be amazed at the amount of dirt you remove, even with the smallest patio. Compacted earth, once dug up and tossed, tends to double its previous size.

Move it as few times as possible — preferably once.

If you’re going to use the dirt to fill in a low area, shovel the sod and dirt right into the wheelbarrow and dump it in its final resting spot.

If it’s going to be hauled away, back the trailer, truck or trash bin as close as you can.

Be equally wise with the materials you haul in.

Do all your excavating, then have your subbase dumped directly on the patio site.

Have your leveling sand and pavers delivered close to the patio. This patio took 2,500 pavers—that’s a lot of hauling by hand!

Consider access to your backyard:
<ul>
 	<li>Can you back a truck close to the patio site?</li>
 	<li>If not, are you prepared to do a lot of hauling by wheelbarrow?</li>
 	<li>Will that heavy truck damage any tree roots or your soft asphalt driveway on a hot day?</li>
 	<li>Have you carefully figured the amount of materials you need before ordering, so you don’t wind up with tons of extra sand, subbase or pavers?</li>
 	<li>Does it make sense to temporarily remove a section of fence for access during the project?</li>
</ul>
Finally, consider recruiting help for some of the more labor-intensive parts: excavating, spreading the subbase, lugging the pavers.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Here’s where being fussy and persnickety pays off!</h2>
You’ve just spent a long day searching the town for that just right piece of garage-sale furniture. And you finally found it! Unfortunately, it looks like the last time your treasured find saw the light of day was when poodle skirts and sock hops were the rage.

So does that mean you should leave without it? No way! If the piece of furniture is solidly constructed and not in need of a lot of repairs, you can give it new life by doing just one thing — painting it.

But before you run down to your local paint store, you must know that if you want to paint furniture and get good results, you have to be very fussy. Rushing the job, skipping steps and general sloppiness won’t cut it.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1750" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/painting-furniture-1024x968.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="527" />
<h2>Time and Money</h2>
Painting furniture doesn’t take hours of continuous work. It does take up one or two short blocks of time each day for about four days. This project was completed over four days, despite working in high humidity, which increases the drying time of most paints.

You’ll spend around $80 for paint, tools, and supplies. And that includes buying a dust mask and a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/respirators/">breathing device</a> if you’re sensitive to paint fumes. You can read more about this in the section “Tips for Safety and Success”.

Also, plan on buying new knobs and hinges. The old ones will look out of place.
<h2>If it’s wood, paint it</h2>
If what you want to paint is a good, old-fashioned piece of wooden furniture, go ahead and follow these steps, regardless of the existing finish.

But if the furniture has a newer high-gloss, plastic laminate surface, you’re out of luck. It can't be painted successfully.
<h2>Getting started</h2>
Before you can do anything, you need to clean the project’s surface.

Get rid of the dust and dirt, especially any greasy residue. The best way to clean it is to wipe it with a rag and some mineral spirits (Photo 1). The mineral spirits will easily cut through greasy dirt. Remember to wipe the sides too.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1751" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/painting-furniture-1-clean-surfaces.jpg" alt="" width="548" height="543" />

<strong>Clean all of the surfaces Io be painted. If the furniture is dirty or grimy, use mineral spirits to cut through the really bad stuff. Remember to clean the sides too — they do get dirty.</strong>

You need to “dull” the entire surface so the new paint will adhere. If you don't, your project will peel and chip easily. Before you start dulling the surface, remove the existing hardware. Now sand all the areas to be painted to dull the surface (Photo 2).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1752" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/painting-furniture-2-sand-workpiece.jpg" alt="" width="838" height="635" />

<strong>Sand the entire piece, including the drawer fronts, to remove the shine so that the new paint will adhere. A medium (100-grit) sandpaper works well. If necessary, use a fine (220-grit) sandpaper after the medium sandpaper.</strong>

A word of caution: If the old surface was painted before the 1980s, the paint probably contains lead. So instead of sanding, dull it with a liquid deglosser — that's what it’s called and it's sold at paint stores.

If the old surface is stained and varnished, go ahead and sand it. Sanding is the recommended method for dulling surfaces. Sand only enough to eliminate the shine on the surface. If some of the finish is peeling, sand those areas until you remove the peeling finish and there's a smooth tapered edge between the peeling area and the rest of the surface

Medium (100-grit) sandpaper will do the trick. It removes enough of the old finish to ensure good adhesion of the new paint, without making the surface too rough. If the surface seems a little rough after sanding with 100-grit, go over it again with 220-grit.

Use a sanding block and sandpaper for the large, flat surfaces, but small surfaces are easier to sand with the sandpaper only. If the furniture has intricately carved areas, you may need to use a sanding sponge, sanding tape or sanding string. These products are available at well-stocked paint stores or at woodworking stores.
<h2>Fixing the eyesores</h2>
Your piece of furniture will most likely have a few nicks and dings. But you can easily fill these with any brand-name wood filler that's sold at the paint store.

Apply the wood filler with a putty knife (Photo 3). If the gouge is fairly deep, more than 1/2 in., fill it in two layers, letting each coat dry completely to get a solid repair.

Once the filler has dried (check the container for drying time), you can sand it smooth, usually with fine sandpaper. Make sure the edge between the filled area and the wood is smooth.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1753" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/painting-furniture-3-use-wood-filler.jpg" alt="" width="547" height="545" />

<strong>Fill all nicks and gauges with wood filler. Apply the wood filler with a putty knife, wait for it to dry and then sand it smooth. Any brand-name wood filler will work. Read the container label for drying times.</strong>
<h2>Priming</h2>
Before you apply the primer, you need to clean off all of the sanding dust and residue. The best way to do this is to wipe the entire project with a tack cloth (Photo 4).

A tack cloth is a piece of cheesecloth that has been coated with a waxy residue — it's available at paint stores for about $2.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1754" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/painting-furniture-4-wipe-sanded-surfaces.jpg" alt="" width="546" height="547" />

<strong>Wipe all of the sanded surfaces with a tack cloth. The sticky coating on the tack cloth picks up the sanding residue. Remember to turn the tack cloth periodically to maximize its cleaning ability.</strong>

If you own a shop vacuum, you may want to use it to vacuum up the heavy sanding residue before wiping with the tack cloth.

Now apply an oil-based primer (Photo 5). This goes on easily and provides the best surface for applying the top coats, regardless of the type of paint (oil or latex) that you use for the top coat.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1755" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/painting-furniture-5-prime-all-surfaces.jpg" alt="" width="641" height="635" />

<strong>Prime the surfaces with a good oil-based primer. Oil-based primers brush an easily, dry quickly and provide the best surface for paint adhesion.</strong>

Any top-quality, brand-name oil-based primer will work. Most paint companies recommend using their own brand of primer. I used two different brands of primer and paint, though, and still had great results.

Most primers dry quickly, often in under 30 minutes. And with many brands, you can apply the paint as soon as the primer is dry.
<h2>Choosing your paint</h2>
The type of top coat paint you choose depends on the finished look you want. To get a bright, wet look, go with a high-gloss alkyd, or oil-based enamel like in Photo 6. If you're looking for a softer finish, use a latex enamel. Either one will give you a tough finish.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1756" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/painting-furniture-6-paint-primed-surfaces.jpg" alt="" width="713" height="614" />

<strong>Paint the primed surfaces with an alkyd or latex enamel. Alkyd enamels will have a wet look when dry; latex enamels have a smoother, satin look when dry. Multiple coats are necessary for a good, tough finish.</strong>

Plan on applying at least two coats of enamel. I applied three coats to get a durable, bright, shiny finish.

Don’t rush your painting. Wait until the previous coat is completely dry — with no tackiness at all — before recoating. If you don't wait long enough, you could end up having to strip off the new paint and start over.

Finally, some paints recommend, or require, sanding between coats — follow the directions on the can. But whether you sand between coats or not, wipe the surface with the tack cloth between coats. You’ll be amazed at how much dust the tack cloth will remove.
<h2>Tips for safety and success</h2>
Here are a few things to remember so that your project is a success and you work safely:
<ul>
 	<li>There's no need to completely sand off the old finish to get ready for painting. You’re trying to get rid of the shine, not the old color.</li>
 	<li>Wear a dust mask when sanding. These masks are inexpensive, and they help protect your lungs from dust particles.</li>
 	<li>Work in a well-ventilated area. If you’re sensitive to paint fumes, wear a <a href=" http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/respirators/">breathing protection device (respirator) </a> designed for filtering out paint fumes — a paper dust mask does not protect you from paint fumes.</li>
 	<li>Use a paint brush designed for the type of paint you’re using. A high-quality brush will have a protective sleeve that describes the type of paint the brush is best suited for. The instructions on the can of alkyd enamel I used recommended using a natural-bristle brush. It wasn’t cheap ($20 for a 3-in. wide brush), but it allowed the paint to go on smoothly and evenly.</li>
 	<li>Don’t try to save time by skipping steps — especially priming. An unprimed surface requires more coats of paint, and the paint won’t cover as evenly or go as far.</li>
 	<li>When you prime and paint drawers, do only the drawer fronts and their edges. Paint on the sides or edges of the drawers will make them stick.</li>
 	<li>The surfaces must be clean or every imperfection will show. Wipe the surfaces again with the tack cloth.</li>
 	<li>Make sure the room you’re working in is <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/small-woodshop-dust-collection/">as dust-free as possible</a>. The dust in the air will settle on the wet, painted surfaces, so vacuum the room before painting.</li>
 	<li>Rags with oily dirt residue or those saturated with cleaning solvents, such as mineral spirits, should be dried outside in the sun. Then they can be safely thrown in the trash.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Make minor repairs now, before they become major problems.</h2>
Ceramic tile. It's functional, durable and beautiful. But after a while, your tile floors, walls or counter-tops probably don’t look as nice as they did when they were new. Some of the tiles may be cracked, broken or even missing.

So, what can you do to recreate that like-new look? You could rip it all out and start over with new tile, but that’s expensive.

For an easier and much less expensive alternative, follow this ceramic tile repair guide to find out how to deal with those tile hassles and headaches.
<h2>Problems, Products, And People</h2>
Ceramic tile can fail on any of three fronts: the tile, the grout or the caulk. You’ll learn the most common repairs and what materials and tools you'll need.

The best place to buy tools and materials is at a specialty tile shop. Besides finding all of the stuff you’ll need, you’ll be able to talk with salespeople who handle tile repair questions every day.

If you decide your tile is too far gone to repair, read my <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/tiling/">Ceramic Tile Guide</a>. It’s loaded with information on how to plan a tile layout and install floor and wall tiles.

Giving you an exact cost for repairs is tough since tile and grout prices vary quite a bit. However. the tools should cost $40 or less.
<h2>Matching Old Tiles</h2>
One of the toughest ceramic tile problems is trying to match the existing tiles. Tile colors change as often as the color trends in wallpaper and paint. Tile sizes change too, with tile thickness being a frequent culprit. The odds are you won't find an exact match.

But don't despair. There are options.

You can replace a few tiles and create a new pattern, which will give the room a whole new look.

Another alternative is to borrow a good tile from an inconspicuous place, such as behind the toilet or the sink cabinet.

If you decide to try this, you should know that you'll be trying to remove a tile that’s usually firmly attached to the wall. Removing a tile without damaging it is often difficult and sometimes impossible.
<h2>Tile Problems</h2>
Ceramic tiles can break, come loose or chip. You can replace broken ones and resecure a loose tile, but there's no good fix for nicks and chips. Let’s start with the most involved repair — a broken tile.
<h3>Replacing a Broken Tile</h3>
Whether the broken tile is on the floor (like mine) or on the wall, the steps for replacing it are similar.

The first thing to do is remove the damaged tile. If it's loose, which it often is, you should be able to pry it up with a screwdriver.

If not, break the tile into smaller pieces using a hammer and cold chisel (Photo 1).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1766" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/repairing-ceramic-tile-01-remove-damaged-tile.jpg" alt="" width="779" height="749" />

<strong>Remove the damaged tile with a hammer and cold chisel. Ceramic tile is brittle — small pieces will fly. Wear eye protection! Remove the old grout too. Be careful not to chip the surrounding tiles.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1765" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/repairing-ceramic-tile-01-inset.jpg" alt="" width="482" height="427" />

<strong>Place the tip of the cold chisel at the crack or break and then hit the chisel with the hammer (photo above).</strong>

Be careful. Ceramic tile is brittle and easy to break. And when you strike it, small pieces will go flying. Wear <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/eye-protection/">eye protection</a> and work gloves!

Once all of the tile is removed, you need to break out the old grout that’s around it. Use the chisel and hammer to do this too, but be careful that you don’t chip the good tiles.

Next, remove the old adhesive from the floor or wall with the cold chisel (Photo 2). Remove as much of the adhesive as you can, but don’t worry if you leave some of it behind. Just make sure that the surface is smooth. Once the adhesive has been scraped loose, sweep or vacuum it up.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1767" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/repairing-ceramic-tile-02-scrape-off-old-adhesive.jpg" alt="" width="354" height="346" />

<strong>Scrape all the old adhesive with a cold chisel. Remove as much as possible so the new tile will adhere properly. Scraping is the best way to remove the adhesive.</strong>

Don’t use a heat gun or solvent to soften the old adhesive. This makes the job very messy and you won't remove any more adhesive than by simply scraping.

The type of adhesive you use to secure the new tile depends on the type of tile you’re replacing. For floor files, like I’m showing, use thin-set mortar. It comes in a powder that you mix with water. For wall tiles, use premixed mastic adhesive. Tile stores sell both of these products.

Apply a liberal amount of mortar to the back of the floor tile (Photo 3). Be sure to spread it out to the tile edges. Wear rubber gloves too. Mortar or mastic is tough to get off of your hands after it dries.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1768" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/repairing-ceramic-tile-03-apply-mortar.jpg" alt="" width="355" height="345" />

<strong>Apply the mortar to the back of the tile, spreading it out to the edges. If you’re replacing floor tiles, use thin-set mortar; for wall tile, use pre-mixed mastic adhesive.</strong>

Set the tile in place and check the spacing between the tiles. Make sure the spacing matches up with all the other grout lines.

Once the tile is in place, use a short length of wood and a hammer to gently tap it down (Photo 4). You don't need to pound on the wood too hard — just enough to set the tile into the adhesive and to get it level with the surrounding tiles. Wipe away any excess adhesive that oozes out from under the tile.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1769" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/repairing-ceramic-tile-04-set-tile-firmly.jpg" alt="" width="356" height="348" />

<strong>Set the tile firmly into the mortar, level with the surrounding tiles, by placing a short length of wood on the tile and gently tapping the wood with a hammer.</strong>

Check the package label for the adhesive’s drying time before moving on to the next step.

Once the adhesive is dry, regrout around the new tile. Grout also comes in powder form that you mix with water. If you’re regrouting floor tiles, use a sanded grout; for wall tiles. use non-sanded grout. Again, wear rubber gloves — the lime in the grout really dries out your hands.

Matching grout color can be a little tricky, although most tile stores carry a variety of grout colors. You can also buy a grout colorant — a powder that you add to the grout before mixing it with water—to help match your grout.

Spread the grout across the tiles with a rubber grout float (Photo 5). Hold the float at a 45-degree angle. Move it in both directions to work the grout into the gaps between the tiles.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1770" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/repairing-ceramic-tile-05-spread-grout.jpg" alt="" width="358" height="347" />

<strong>Spread the grout using a rubber gram float, holding it at a 45-degree angle to the tile. Move the grout in both directions. Use a grout that matches your existing grout.</strong>

Let the grout set for 10 to 15 minutes and then wipe the area with a damp grout sponge. A grout sponge has rounded corners that work the grout into the gaps and shape the grout lines. Once the grout has dried — again, check the package for drying time — wipe off the residue with a soft cloth.

Finally, apply a penetrating grout sealer. Penetrating sealers fill the grout pores and harden the surface, reducing the absorption of dirt and mold.
<h3>Fixing a Loose Soap Dish</h3>
Resecuring that loose tile soap dish that’s been bugging you for months is no big deal. If you want to reuse the old one, you need to scrape all of the old adhesive from the back of the soap dish and the wall. However. it may be easier to just buy a new soap dish if you can find a color to match or one you like.

Some soap dishes, especially those installed in the 1980’s and before, are actually part of the wall tile pattern. They’re set into the adhesive like regular wall tiles and then grouted.

Most of the soap dishes sold now are designed to be mounted directly on a wall tile or tiles If your soap dish is part of the wall pattern, follow the steps described in “Replacing a Broken Tile." If the soap dish is mounted on top of a tile, do the following:

Coat the back of the soap dish, including filling the holes in the back of the dish, with 100% silicone rubber adhesive caulk (Photo 6). Use 100% silicone rubber adhesive caulk for this and the other caulk repairs. It costs a little more than latex, but it’s the best.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1771" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/repairing-ceramic-tile-06-mount-soap-dish.jpg" alt="" width="455" height="447" />

<strong>Mount a soap dish using 100% silicone rubber adhesive caulk on the entire back of the dish. Be sure to fill the holes in the back of the dish with caulk too.</strong>

Position the soap dish on the wall and secure it with a couple of strips of heavy-duty tape — duct tape works well. Place one strip horizontally and the other vertically (Photo 7). Leave the tape in place overnight, or the soap dish could end up in the tub in the morning.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1772" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/repairing-ceramic-tile-07-position-soap-dish.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="346" />

<strong>Position the soap dish on the wall and secure it with duct tape. Place one strip of tape horizontally and another vertically. Leave the tape in place overnight.</strong>

Once the soap dish is firmly attached, apply a head of the caulk where the soap dish meets the wall tile.
<h3>Chipped Tiles</h3>
A chipped tile doesn’t cause any structural problems. It's only an eyesore. Unfortunately, there’s really no surefire way to repair chips.

The best Band-Aid fix is to try to find an acrylic paint or permanent marker that matches the tile color and use it to coat the chipped area.
<h2>Grout Problems</h2>
Most grout problems require you to do one of two things: If the grout is cracked, loose, or missing, you should replace it. If it's discolored, you need to clean it.
<h3>Replacing Grout</h3>
Removing grout can be a piece of cake or a nasty job. And you won't know which category yours is going to be in until you start. Removing loose, cracked or broken grout is a slow, hard job, and you must be thorough to get good results.

The simplest way to remove bad grout is with a grout saw (Photo 8). A professional-style saw has two blades that work together: One blade has conventional-looking saw teeth to break up and rake out the grout; the other blade has a rough, almost sandpaper-like edge to clean out any remaining grout and to smooth rough spots along the edge of the tile.

Move the grout saw back and forth — as if you were sawing wood — to loosen and clean out the grout. Be particularly careful not to nick or chip the tile edges.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1774" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/repairing-ceramic-tile-08-remove-old-grout.jpg" alt="" width="605" height="546" />

<strong>Remove the old grout with a grout saw. The professional-style saw uses two different types of blades to break up and remove the grout. Be careful not to nick or chip the tiles when sawing.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1773" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/repairing-ceramic-tile-08-inset-good-bad-grout-comparison.jpg" alt="" width="251" height="315" />

<strong>Remove any grout that's loose or cracked. A solid grout line doesn’t need to be removed.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1762" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DEWALT-DWA4220-Oscillating-Fastcut-Carbide-Grout-Removal-Blade-2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" />

You can also avoid the manual labor and buy yourself an oscillating grout removal blade, and remove grout with your oscillating multi-tool. Al the tips above work the same, the only difference is that you’ll make the same chore in much less time.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1761" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DEWALT-DWA4220-Oscillating-Fastcut-Carbide-Grout-Removal-Blade-1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" />

<strong>The DWA4220 by Dewalt has a universal fitment which is compatible with all major tool brands. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FRMZVMI/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Click here to buy it from Amazon</a>.</strong>

Once the grout is out, clean the surface thoroughly with a solution of phosphoric acid (available at the tile store) and water (Photo 9). Phosphoric acid sounds tough and it is. But it's really not hard on your hands, especially when it’s diluted with water. If you have sensitive skin, though, wear rubber gloves. Also, if your shower has a glass door, don't let the solution get on the glass. It will etch the glass.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1775" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/repairing-ceramic-tile-09-clean-surface.jpg" alt="" width="354" height="347" />

<strong>Clean the surface with a solution of phosphoric acid and water. If you have sensitive skin, wear rubber gloves. Don’t let the solution get on a glass shower door—it will etch the glass!</strong>

Regrout the tiles after the surface has dried. Again, try to match the grout color as closely as possible to make the repair less visible.

Mix the grout according to the package instructions and then apply it using a rubber grout float (Photo 10). Hold the float at a 45-degree angle to the wall and spread the grout across the tiles. Move the grout in both directions. Be sure to apply sufficient pressure to force the grout into the gaps.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1776" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/repairing-ceramic-tile-10-spread-grout.jpg" alt="" width="353" height="345" />

<strong>Spread the grout using a rubber grout float. Hold the float at a 45-degree angle to the wall and move it in both directions to spread the grout. Use a non-sanded grout for wall tiles.</strong>

After the grout has set for about 30 minutes, wipe the area with a dampened grout sponge to shape the new grout lines to match the existing ones.

Now let the grout dry for an additional hour, and then wipe the tiles and grout with a soft cloth to remove any residue.

After the grout has dried completely (usually within 24 to 48 hours, but check the package for specific times), apply a penetrating sealer to both the grout and the tiles (Photo 11).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1777" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/repairing-ceramic-tile-11-apply-sealer.jpg" alt="" width="355" height="346" />

<strong>Apply a penetrating sealer to the grout and tiles after the grout has dried. Check the grout package for drying time. Reapply penetrating sealer annually to extend the life of the grout.</strong>
<h3>Cleaning Grout</h3>
Whether it’s white, gray or a trendy designer color, grout gets dirty. But there’s no need to replace it if the grout is intact.

Most grout can be cleaned with the phosphoric acid and water solution described in the previous section. If the grout is really dirty, use the acid undiluted. Wear rubber gloves if you have sensitive skin, regardless of which solution you use.

The best way to scrub grout is with a nylon-bristle grout brush (Photo 12). The bristles are stiff enough so that you can scrub hard. Repeat scrubbing as needed.

<strong>Scrub the grout with the phosphoric acid/water solution using a nylon-bristle grout brush. The long, stiff bristles let you scrub hard to remove dirt and mildew. Repeat scrubbing as needed.</strong>
<h2>Caulk Problems</h2>
Most people don’t associate caulk or caulk problems with ceramic tile. But some tile joints must be flexible, yet leak-free, to ensure a long life for the tile, grout, and the subsurface. The best way to get a leak-free, flexible joint is to caulk it.
<h3>Bathtub-Tile Caulk Joint</h3>
A good caulk joint is needed where the bathtub and tile meet. If the caulk or grout is split, missing or covered with mold and mildew, clean out the area and recaulk the gap (Photo 13).

A screwdriver should do the trick, but be careful not to chip the tiles or scratch the tub surface You don’t need to regrout between the tub and tile — a solid head of caulk will keep the water out.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1779" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/repairing-ceramic-tile-13-remove-bad-caulk.jpg" alt="" width="599" height="485" />

<strong>Remove cracked or badly stained caulk and grout from the tile and tub joint. Clean the area with the acid/water solution. Apply a bead of 100% silicone rubber caulk. You don’t have to regrout the gap — the caulk will seal it.</strong>

Before you apply the caulk, clean the area with the phosphoric acid solution. Dry the surface completely and then apply a bead of 100% silicone rubber adhesive caulk.

Also, apply caulk where the water handles and tub spout meet the wall tiles. This prevents water from getting behind the handles and spout and penetrating the wall where the water supply pipes come through.
<h3>Countertop/Backsplash Grout Joints</h3>
If you have a tile countertop and backsplash in your kitchen or bathroom, listen up. The joint formed where these two surfaces meet really gets abused. Every time you close a drawer or bump the countertop you jar the joint. And while these bumps may seem minor, over time they can and usually do crack the grouted joint.

Photo 14 shows a head of 100% silicone rubber adhesive caulk being applied directly over the grouted joint. The caulk helps prevent the grout from cracking whenever the countertop is bumped. If the grout joint is already cracked, remove it and regrout before applying the caulk.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1780" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/repairing-ceramic-tile-14-apply-silicone-caulk.jpg" alt="" width="599" height="429" />

<strong>Apply a bead of 100% silicone adhesive caulk over the grouted joint between the countertop and backsplash. Use clear caulk if you can’t find a caulk to match the grout color.</strong>

Notice that the caulk being applied looks white — but it will dry clear. (Many clear caulks are white when they come out of the tube.) A clear caulk was used because it's very difficult to find a caulk, especially silicone rubber, to match the grout color. If you do find one to match, use it. If not, use clear.

Moisten your finger with water and then smooth out the head of caulk (Photo 15). Keep a small amount of water and a rag handy.

Dip your finger in the water frequently to keep it wet; use the rag to wipe off the excess caulk that will collect on your finger as you smooth the joint.

<strong>Dip your finger in water and then run it on the bead of caulk to smooth and shape it. Keep a small amount of water handy to keep your finger moist. As you’re smoothing, wipe off the excess caulk that will collect on your finger.</strong>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Beat Your Roof&#039;s Three Worst Enemies (Worn Out Shingles, Failing Flashings, Poor Ventilation)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You'll never appreciate a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/roof-types-structure/">leak-proof roof</a> as much as <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/leaky-roofs-causes-and-solutions/">when you don't have one</a>. Believe me, shuffling pans and buckets around the attic to catch drips on a stormy night can be a nightmare.

Fortunately, this nightmare doesn’t occur often. Roofs and the products we use to cover them withstand billions of raindrops, tons of snow and ice, baking and frigid temperature extremes, and sometimes natural disasters like hurricanes and tornadoes.

Eventually, however, roofs wear out.

Here I'll explain how asphalt shingles break down and fail. I'll limit this discussion to asphalt shingles because that's what roofers put on about 80 percent of the homes in the United States and Canada.

Cedar shingles or shakes, tile or metal roofs cover the other 20 percent. However, if your roof is among these, this article should help you as well, because many of the same factors that cause leaks in asphalt roofs will cause leaks in these other materials too.

Flat, or nearly flat roofs have unique problems of their own, but sorry, I won't talk about them here.
<h2>How A Roof Breaks Down</h2>
If it weren't for natural disasters, which sometimes not only blows off shingles but entire roofs, asphalt shingle roofs would generally live a long and useful life. Rain, snow, ice, and cold weather hardly affect them.

But regardless of your location, all asphalt shingles have a common enemy — the sun.

The first signs of trouble might be a pile of tiny colored granules that you notice under leaves and other debris as you clean out your gutters (Fig. A).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1785" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/roof-leaks-fig-a-how-shingles-deteriorate.jpg" alt="" width="987" height="830" />

<strong>Ultraviolet (UV) rays and heat from the sun break down asphalt shingles, causing them to turn brittle, shrink, crack, curl, cup, and lose their coating of mineral granules.</strong>

Or while up on the roof retrieving your daughter's boomerang, you might hear the shingles crack or break underfoot. Or perhaps you'll see some shingle edges curled upward or downward. All these signs indicate that your roof is nearing its end and you’ll probably want to replace it within the next few years.

By this time, the sun has done its damage. An asphalt shingle is basically a fiber mat soaked in hot asphalt and then cooled. Asphalt sheds water well, but it can’t shed the sun's high-energy ultraviolet (UV) rays. These rays gradually break down the asphalt, causing shingles to lose their flexibility, become brittle, shrink and crack.

Manufacturers design shingles to resist this breakdown in two ways. First, they cover the asphalt with hard mineral granules to block the UV waves (and make our roofs colorful).

However, after a decade or so, many of these granules will have eroded off the shingle surface, leaving the asphalt more exposed and vulnerable. At that point, deterioration speeds up. Incidentally, walking on the roof, especially on hot days, can knock off the granules too, so stay off your roof as much as possible.

As a second defense, manufacturers increase the amount of asphalt in some grades of shingles. These thicker grades take longer to break down. They cost more, but can last 30 to 40 years, compared to thinner shingles that might last only 15 to 20 years. (Manufacturers rate the quality of shingles by how long they should last.)

Of course, in reality, shingle longevity depends on how much sun hits the roof. Shingles in sunny Phoenix take a greater beating than those in cloudy Seattle. For that matter, the north-facing side of your roof might last twice as long as the south-facing side, because it catches less direct sunlight.

There's not much you can do to protect your roof from the direct rays of the sun, but you do have some control over the second factor that destroys roofs — heat. Root temperatures in the desert Southwest can hit 200 degrees F, and most roofs throughout the United States and Canada hit at least the 160-degree F mark several times each summer. This sizzling heat breaks down the asphalt by softening the shingles and drying them out, so they become more brittle when they cool.

You can reduce the heat buildup on your roof by making sure your attic is well ventilated. Vents located in the roof overhang and high near the ridge on top allow cool air to enter the low vents, flow along the underside of the hot root sheathing, cool the roof and exit as hot air through the high vents. This airflow can reduce the roof temperature as much as 20 degrees F. Attic fans, common on many homes in the South, assure an even better flow

Good ventilation extends the life of your roof, but no one is sure how much. Manufacturers are running aging experiments on shingle roots to find out.

But whether or not that 20-degree temperature variation extends your root's life, there’s no question that the shingles on your roof will eventually wear out. However, experts say this is generally not the main cause of leaks. Homeowners usually spot the worn roof and replace it before leaks occur. The real culprit is inadequate flashing
<h2>Leaks Around The Flashing</h2>
Flashing consists of sheet metal, heavy asphalt or other flexible waterproof materials that roofers put at vulnerable spots on the roof. That includes such places as dormers, chimneys, plumbing pipes and valleys (Fig. B).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1786" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/roof-leaks-fig-b-how-flashings-fail.jpg" alt="" width="741" height="629" />
<ol>
 	<li>Metal flashing can tear around chimneys or where it was re-bent during a reroofing job. Rooters sometimes drive nails through the metal too close to corners when reroofing.</li>
 	<li>Asphalt cement, which substitutes for flashing tucked into the mortar joints in masonry chimneys, will leak after a few years.</li>
 	<li>Valley Flashing can crack if it’s stepped on.</li>
 	<li>Damaged siding or cracked stucco allows water to get behind the flashing and into the walls.</li>
 	<li>Water backed up behind ice dams can seep through the roof unless cave flashing under the shingles stops it.</li>
</ol>
Chimneys cause the most problems.

Because it’s so heavy, a chimney has its own foundation, so it settles and moves independently of the house. This movement can cause flashings to stretch and tear open. Furthermore, you have to tuck chimney flashing into the mortar joints to keep water from running down behind the flashing.

Unfortunately, roofers don't always do a good job here, especially after the original flashing wears out. Installing chimney flashing is a job for an expert. Few roofers have the skills to restore it, and often a homeowner simply doesn’t want to cough up the dough for a first-class job. The cheap, quick solution is to fill gaps with plastic roof cement. Unfortunately, this doesn’t last long. The cement will harden and crack within a few years and leaks soon begin.

Many chimneys were built without an angled “saddle.” A saddle looks like a small roof added to the back side of a chimney. It keeps rain, snow, and ice from collecting there and prematurely corroding the flashing. All chimneys should have one. (Skylights should have some type of special flashing on their backside for the same reason.)

“Valley flashing," the covering used to protect the junction where two roof sections meet, is especially vulnerable as it ages. Unless it's metal, it becomes brittle and will crack if you step on it when clearing a dead branch from the roof. Remind anyone who climbs up on your roof not to step in a valley.

Flashing at a roof/wall junction sometimes leaks because a roofer drove a nail through it when putting on a second layer of shingles. But more often, the siding itself has rotted or cracked, so water can penetrate the siding (wood or stucco) and run down behind the flashing.

One type of flashing. called "eave flashing," is a strip of asphalt roofing that runs along the lower edge of your roof under the shingles to protect the roof from ice dams in regions with snowfall. An ice dam occurs when water from melting snow freezes near the edge of the roof and traps other melt water behind it. This water can run back up under the shingles and will leak into your house, unless you have eave flashing to block it. While good roof ventilation will prevent most ice dams, eave flashing helps prevent leaks even if ice dams occur.

We can point out where problems commonly occur to help you find leaks. But even so, pinpointing the exact spot isn't always easy. Water can enter along the chimney, run down the underside of the roof, drip into the attic insulation near the outside wall, and appear only after it soaks through the drywall or plaster ceiling, nowhere near where it began. Often you'll have to climb into the attic with a flashlight to trace the leak's path back to its source.

The best fix is to install the flashing properly. Experts report that all too often the primary cause of flashing failure is improper installation in the first place.

Flashing is the most important part of roofing, but it easily gets shortchanged because its slow, tedious work that has to be done just so. Roofers, who are paid by how many shingles they lay, have little incentive to do it carefully, unless you insist and are willing to pay the price.

To make sure the flashing is installed properly, hire experienced roofers who will explain how they plan to do it. Before you make your final payment to the roofer, confirm with your building inspector that it was done right.
<h2>Roof Failure From The Inside</h2>
After you go through so much trouble to have a new roof installed properly, it hardly seems fair that your roof (in a cold region) can fail from the underside too.

An experienced roofing contractor friend of mine told me about the time when he was called in to investigate a leak complaint and discovered that the shingles and flashings were perfectly sound.

But in the attic he found numerous nails poking through the roof sheathing, where they had been driven when an old roof had been removed. The nails were white with frost. Whenever the roof heated up during the day, the frost melted and dripped down onto the ceilings below (Fig. C).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1787" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/roof-leaks-fig-c-poor-ventilation-damage.jpg" alt="" width="733" height="659" />

<strong>When an attic has poor ventilation, moisture carried by humid air from the house below will rise and condense on the cold roof sheathing and rafters. Wet sheathing will rot, and water dripping from nails will wet the insulation and discolor the ceiling below. Here, what normally would be good ventilation provided by a soffit vent has been blocked by insulation improperly stuffed against the roof sheathing.</strong>

Then the nails frosted up again at night. From this observation, my friend always recommends pulling all old nails from previous roofing jobs when tearing off old shingles, rather than driving them down into the wood.

Even worse, my friend has seen the roof boards in some attics completely white with frost and soaked in places The icing was caused by warm, humid air from the house below rising up into the attic where the moisture it contained condensed on the cold underside of the root (Fig. C). The dampness caused the roof to rot from below.

Preventing this problem is a far better solution than replacing sections of rotted roof.

To begin with, you can close up a lot of those air leaks to keep moisture out of your attic. But you also must supply good attic ventilation to flush out the moisture that gets into the attic anyway. The same vents that cool your roof in the summer vent humid air in the winter.

From his experience, my friend estimates that most attics across the northern half of the United States and in Canada are notoriously underventilated, and even the building code requirement (1 sq. ft. of ventilation for every 150 to 300 sq. ft. of attic area) isn't always enough.

Technically, of course, ventilation isn’t a roofer’s problem. But better roofing contractors will discuss ventilation with you before they work on your roof because they know how quickly poor ventilation can lead to rot. And they can spot such trouble easily if they have to replace rotten roof sheathing before they can put on new shingles.

After a contractor makes a recommendation, check the ventilation plan with your local building inspector to make sure it’ll do the job.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[DlYers are a resourceful bunch, saving scraps of wood, wire, and pipe for projects yet unknown. We should be just as careful in saving a truly precious asset – our eyesight.

Nearly 1 million Americans are visually impaired or blind due to eye injuries; 92.3% of those injuries could have been avoided with proper safety practices and protective eyewear.
<h2>Glasses, Goggles, or Face Shield?</h2>
You have these options:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Full-face shields</strong>. These offer full-face protection and are ideal for blocking chips and shavings from lathes or routers. Since they don't offer good protection against heavy impact or from objects that fly up or around the face shield, always wear safety glasses or goggles too. Full-face shields with a head band start at around the price of a pair of goggles.</li>
 	<li><strong>Goggles</strong>. They provide front, side, top, and bottom protection.
<ul>
 	<li>Those with “direct vents” allow good air circulation, minimize fogging and are adequate for sawing and hammering.</li>
 	<li>Those with “indirect vents” offer added protection from fine particles or chemical splashes.</li>
 	<li>Goggles with pliable sides are more comfortable to wear and provide a cushion against impact. Many can be worn over prescription glasses.</li>
 	<li>Goggles can be cumbersome to put on and take off and can limit peripheral vision, but if you're going to buy only one pair of protective eyewear, get goggles; they‘ll protect you in most situations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Safety glasses</strong>. These are the most compact form of protective eyewear. Those with side shields will block particles from entering at the sides. Safety glasses offer adequate protection when hammering, using hand tools or slow-moving electric tools. Some are designed with wide bows to slip over prescription glasses.</li>
 	<li><strong>Prescription safety glasses</strong>. Those with polycarbonate lenses and side shields offer the best protection. The frames, available in plastic or metal, are also more rugged than ordinary eyeglass frames. Most eyewear stores can supply these. They come in a wide array of styles, including designer frames.</li>
</ul>
When welding or brazing, always wear shaded eyewear to protect eyes from the brightness and infrared light. You should also wear protective safety glasses to guard against flying particles and sparks.

<strong>Buy a product that’s both right for the job and comfortable. If it's uncomfortable, chances are you won't wear it.</strong>
<h2>Face Shields</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1801" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/eye-protection-a-face-shield.jpg" alt="" width="665" height="688" />

Face shields offer eye and full-face protection but must ALWAYS be worn with safety goggles or glasses.
<h3>Face Shield With A Chin Guard</h3>
Shields with a chin guard offer added protection from splashes, dust, and flying debris.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1792" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Eye-Protection-01-Sellstrom-S38140-Face-Shield-with-Chin-Guard.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="520" />
<p class="box">I selected the Sellstrom S38140 as the best shield with a face guard because it has a clear polycarbonate window has an anti-fog finish. It’s also lightweight, and resistant to tough jobs such as grinding, chipping, cutting, and so on. It is OSHA compliant and made in the USA. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EXBJZ52/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Buy it from Amazon by clicking here.</a></p>

<h3>Face Shield With Welding Shade</h3>
Specially shaded lenses in welding helmets are a must for welding or brazing.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1793" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Eye-Protection-02-Sellstrom-S32251-Grinding-Face-Shield-with-Shade.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="520" />
<p class="box">I picked the Sellstrom S32251 because it has many of the benefits from the S38140 model above (clear polycarbonate window with an anti-fog finish, lightweight, resistant to tough jobs such as grinding, chipping, and cutting, and it’s made in the USA). It adds the flip-up shade, so you can perform your plasma or flame cutting, brazing, and so on. ANSI Z87 + high impact, CSA Z94.3. You can order it from Amazon in Shades 5, 6, and 8. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01K4B7IO0/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Click here to go to Amazon and choose yours now.</a></p>

<h3>Wire Mesh Shield</h3>
Wire mesh shields are cool and lightweight, ideal for chainsaw cutting and other outdoor work. Making a choice here basically depends on whether you already own ear protection or not.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1794" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Eye-Protection-03-a-Zenport-FS825-Face-Shield-with-Adjustable-Mesh-Visor.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="563" />
<p class="box">The Zenport FS825 protects your face from flying wood chips. I chose it because it’s easy to adjust and it won’t break the bank. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B5TIWQO/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Click here to find it on Amazon.</a></p>

<p class="box">What I like the most about the Oregon 563474 is that it adds a ventilated helmet and earmuffs in the same package, so you will always work safe. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016YVOHPM/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">The user reviews on this one are especially good, click here to see them for yourself.</a></p>

<h2>Goggles</h2>
Goggles provide the best all-around protection, period.
<h3>Direct Vent Goggles</h3>
Direct vent goggles, which protect eyes from chips and large particles, provide air circulation through small holes.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1796" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Eye-Protection-04-Sellstrom-S81010-Direct-Vent-Safety-Goggle-Anti-Fog-Lens.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="520" />
<p class="box">I chose the Sellstrom S81010 it is super clear, and it has an anti-fog finish. You can also wear it over your glasses if they are on the smaller size. (Keep reading below if you have big glasses.) Plus they are super cheap, which also makes them a great choice for having around extra safety glasses for those times when random helpers come to lend you a hand. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CA8DZ7U/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Here’s the Amazon link.</a></p>

<h3>Indirect Vent Goggles</h3>
Indirect vent goggles provide extra protection against liquid splashes and fine particles, provide air circulation through a circuitous route.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1797" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Eye-Protection-05-Sellstrom-S80200-Indirect-Vent-Scratch-Resistant-Anti-Fog-Safety-Goggle.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="340" />
<p class="box">The Sellstrom S80200 Odyssey II is OSHA-compliant, has a scratch-resistant panel with an anti-fog finish, and dual-panel polycarbonate lenses with UV protection. Great choice for dealing with chemicals, sanding exotic hardwoods, or simply going under your car for a DIY oil change. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007CDLC7S/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">The Amazon price is unbeatable, click here and see it for yourself.</a></p>

<h2>Safety Glasses</h2>

<h2>A Personal Tale</h2>
If those “Always Wear Eye Protection” warnings on nail boxes haven’t yet convinced you to use protective eyewear, perhaps a personal tale will.

A friend of mine was working with two carpenters on a house when he heard the unmistakable “ting” of a ricocheting nail, followed by a shriek. He followed the noise and found his pal Chris with a 3-1/2 in. nail embedded in his right eye.

The emergency room nurse told them over the phone to bring him in immediately — with the nail intact — so the eye wouldn’t lose fluid. The 15-minute drive was unimaginably long.

Chris lost sight in that eye, along with three months of work and his dream of becoming a builder. True story.
<h2>When should you wear eye protection?</h2>
Always wear eye protection in the workshop or when using hand or power tools, even when cleaning up. Extend this habit to:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Lawn and garden work</strong>. Thousands of eye injuries occur when stones or sticks are hurled from mowers or when branches snap back while trimming a hedge. Goggles offer the best eye protection for lawn and garden work. A face shield and glasses or goggles should always be worn when using a chainsaw.</li>
 	<li><strong>Automotive work</strong>. Wear goggles when jump-starting a car or working beneath a car where grime can fall into your eyes. Also, protect your eyes when working with antifreeze, brake fluid, engine cleaners and other caustic fluids.</li>
 	<li><strong>Household paints and chemicals</strong>. Wear indirect vent goggles (Photo 5) when using, mixing or pouring oven cleaners, swimming pool chemicals, pesticides and paint thinners. Wear ’em even while painting, especially ceilings.</li>
 	<li><strong>Sports</strong>. Baseball, basketball, tennis, handball, and racquetball are all high-risk sports. Special protective eyewear is available for sports too.</li>
</ul>
Risky situations can’t be predicted. According to the <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Research--Statistics/Injury-Statistics">Consumer Product Safety Commission</a>, in the past few years there were 295 eye injuries from house plants, 387 from underarm deodorants, and 140 injuries from pillows. Be aware of what’s around you and have protective eyewear easily accessible.
<h2>Words from a Wise Old Owl</h2>
The <a href="https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2017/02/03/the-wise-owl-club/">Wise Owl Club</a>, established in 1948, is a safety program of the <a href="https://www.preventblindness.org/eye-safety-work">National Society to Prevent Blindness</a>. It has documented 85,000 cases of people's eyes being saved by wearing eye protection — proof that the place for protective eyewear is on your face, not your workbench or toolbox.

It makes sense to:
<ul>
 	<li>Keep an extra pair of safety goggles for workshop visitors or helpers to wear.</li>
 	<li>Keep a pair of safety eyewear draped over the handle of your lawn mower and other frequently used tools. If they're handy, you'll wear them.</li>
 	<li>Get your kids in the habit of wearing protective eyewear, especially if they’re aspiring woodworkers. Children sustain over 160,000 eye injuries a year.</li>
 	<li>Think in terms of prevention. Many eye injuries are caused by lumber or broom handles that stick out carelessly into a room.</li>
 	<li>Keep your protective eyewear clean. Use an anti-fog, anti-static cleaning solution for best results.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Some Other Considerations</h2>
Protective lenses, whether made from plastic, glass or polycarbonate, will be stamped with the manufacturer's logo to indicate they have passed safety tests. The frames will bear an “<a href="https://blog.ansi.org/2015/08/revision-of-ansiisea-z871/">ANSI/ISEA Z87.1</a>" stamp to indicate they too have passed certain tests.

By far, the most impact-resistant material is polycarbonate; though not unbreakable, it's considered many times stronger than either glass or plastic. Most off-the-shelf goggles and glasses sold these days are polycarbonate.

Ordinary prescription eyeglasses do not offer adequate protection. In fact, everyday glasses can cause greater injury if shards from broken lenses fly into the eye.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Every household needs a power drill, it is one of the most versatile tools you can have. You can use it for multiple jobs around the house such as hanging pictures and shelves, drilling accurate holes very fast, and even building simple pieces of furniture using a dowel jig or a pocket hole jig.

And, yet, <strong>why is it so hard to buy one</strong>? Manufacturers creating misinformation, marketers pushing positive aspects and hiding the rest, and us consumers are simply expected to part ways with our hard earned cash.

<strong>I was interested in buying myself a drill/driver kit with battery</strong>. I am a rational guy and I like to compare numbers. Statistics can still be manipulated; numbers cannot. I think of myself as Mr. Spock from Star Trek, trying to make sense of everything around me.

<strong>Comparing kits is more complicated</strong>. Comparing tools is a feat in itself, plus all brands assemble kits including batteries with different capacities, plus some will include one or two batteries. This is why I decided to create the...
<h2>OBJECTIVE Cordless Drill/Driver Comparison Table</h2>
[table id=13 responsive=collapse /]
<h2>The Best Kits</h2>
<ul class="box">
 	<li><strong>Highest Torque</strong> - Ridgid R86009K - 650 in.lbs (73.44 Nm) - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N90UV5O/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Click for Amazon product page</a></li>
 	<li><strong>Best Included Batteries</strong> - Bosch DDS181A-01 - 4 Ah (x 2 units) - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D4R1IRE/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Click for Amazon product page</a></li>
 	<li><strong>Shortest Length</strong> - Makita XFD11RB - 6.4 in (162 mm) - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0733R5Q5H/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Click for Amazon product page</a></li>
 	<li><strong>Lighest</strong> - Makita XFD11RB - 2.8 lbs (1.27 kg) - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0733R5Q5H/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Click for Amazon product page</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>How To Read This Table</h2>
These are the most important <strong>OBJECTIVE</strong> features you can use to compare drill drivers. I only chose the hard, undeniable numbers, so you can make an informed purchase.
<h3>Torque</h3>
In simple words, it is the <strong>turning force used to drill holes and insert/remove screws</strong> and it is measured at the chuck - where it actually counts. Larger holes and screws or harder materials demand higher torque.

If you have any comments regarding my torque conversions, please read my specific article about it: <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/tool-torque-unit-guide">The Simple Tool Torque Unit Guide: MWO, UWO, in.lbs, and Nm</a>.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N90UV5O/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow"><img class="alert aligncenter wp-image-680 size-full" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Drill-Driver-Ridgid-R86009K-Highest-Torque.png" alt="" width="921" height="128" /></a>
<h3>Speed</h3>
You should look for a drill/driver that can deliver high RPMs and high torque if you know you will work with harder materials and larger screws.
<h3>Number of Batteries</h3>
A kit that includes more than one battery offers you the ability to keep on working with one battery while you recharge the other. Less downtime and higher productivity.
<h3>Battery Capacity</h3>
This is simply the amount of electric charge a battery can hold. and it is measured in Ampère hours (Ah). The higher the Ah rating, the more battery juice you have between charges. A battery rated for 3.0 Ah can deliver:
<ul>
 	<li>3 Amps during 1 hours,</li>
 	<li>6 Amps during 30 minutes, or</li>
 	<li>4.5 Amps during 45 minutes.</li>
</ul>
How much power you will need is directly related to the type of project and materials you will be dealing with.

Tougher materials or larger screws demand more battery power. Laying decking demands more usage time and battery power, or more spare batteries to switch between the one you use and the other you leave charging.

On the other hand, smaller DIY tasks such as hanging a picture frame or fitting hinges to cupboards don't demand much power, so you can save money here and buy lower Amp hour rated batteries.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D4R1IRE/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow"><img class="alert aligncenter wp-image-677 size-full" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Drill-Driver-Bosch-DDS181A-01-Best-Included-Batteries.png" alt="" width="921" height="128" /></a>
<h3>Battery Gauge</h3>
Would you buy a car without a fuel gauge? Then why should you risk ruining your expensive Li-Ion batteries by completely using them until there is no charge left?

Some tool manufacturers offer you a level gauge, others only include a charged/empty indicator, and others do not offer any sort of battery gauge.

Another important benefit is finding out how much charge you have left before climbing up a ladder or going into a tight crawlspace to start working.
<h3>Length</h3>
Important measurement for working in tight spaces - the shorter it is, the more convenient and versatile the unit is.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0733R5Q5H/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow"><img class="alert aligncenter wp-image-679 size-full" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Drill-Driver-Makita-XFD11RB-Shortest-Length.png" alt="" width="921" height="128" /></a>
<h3>Drill &amp; Battery Total Weight</h3>
Usually torque and bulk are directly correlated because a bigger motor and battery will deliver more power. That translates in wrist and arm strain.

If you plan on using your drill/driver for long periods, make sure to look at brushless drill drivers. They tend to be lighter and deliver higher torque and speeds, all while needing less Amp hours to perform the same tasks as brushed units.

I chose to compare total drill and battery weight in my table because this is what you will actually hold in your hand when working.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0733R5Q5H/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow"><img class="alert aligncenter wp-image-678 size-full" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Drill-Driver-Makita-XFD11RB-Lightest-Kit.png" alt="" width="921" height="128" /></a>
<h3>Soft Bag or Hard Case?</h3>
I find no difference because I do most of my work in my workbench.

However, folks who are constantly on the move may have their preferences and should watch out for this as well.
<h3>Adjustable Clutch</h3>
Some also call it torque control or torque clutch, and it is required if you are driving screws.

Before starting the job, you set a maximum torque on the clutch and the drill will not over-drive the screw into your work piece. This is especially recommended if you are driving lots of screws, such as when building a deck.
<h2>Cordless Drill Driver Basics</h2>
Cordless drill drivers are designed to drill holes, insert screws, and remove them.

You can control the drill/drive speed by pressing the speed control. It works very intuitively: by pulling further you increase the drilling speed, while releasing the trigger you slow it down or completely stop.

The chuck is the part that holds the drill bits - as a standard, chucks come with 3 jaws. Most power drills today come with a keyless chuck, so there is a forward/reverse button which serves both to drive or remove screws and to change drill bits.
<h3>Should I Get A Drill, An Impact Driver, Or A Cordless Screwdriver?</h3>
Drills work best for quick drilling and almost all screw-driving.

An impact driver can loosen a complicated screw avoiding to strip its head. Driving a screw with an impact driver also will not damage its head. The “hammering” action, as it is called, is noisier than a drill.

Cordless screwdrivers are lighter, but usually under-powered. A professional model costs around the same as a cordless drill, which is more powerful and versatile.
<h3>Drill Driver Advantages</h3>
<strong>Higher Torque</strong>. More power, higher speeds, and greater torque due to higher-voltage batteries and better gear systems. The average cordless drill-driver delivers 400-500 in-lbs (50-60 Nm) of torque, while cordless screwdrivers only deliver 20% of that. In other words, it is easier to drive larger screws in tougher materials -- plastics, hardwoods, and so on.

<strong>Torque Control</strong>. Set it up accurately and your screws will consistently be at the right depth. You will also avoid damaging the work surface and the screw head. Cordless impact drivers do not have this feature, so you can only control torque by the trigger squeeze and risk sinking the screw below the material's surface.

<strong>3-Jawed Chucks</strong>. They are compatible with both straight-shank drill bits and hexagonal screwdriver bits. Neither impact drivers nor screwdrivers have 3-jawed chucks. In other words, if you want to use either of them for drilling holes, it is very likely you will need to find and purchase hexagonal-shank drill bits.
<h3>Drill Driver Disadvantages</h3>
<strong>Cumbersome</strong>. The higher-capacity battery and the more versatile chuck come at a price: heavier weight and bigger length. Occasional use is not an issue, but long use periods will bring arm and wrist strain, especially if you hold your tool above your head for long periods of time - rafters of a roof, for instance.

<strong>Kick Back</strong>. When the motor is not able to drill a large hole or drive a long screw in a hard material, all its power goes to the tool body - which can potentially strain your wrist and arm as you hold the drill.
<h3>Drill Driver vs Screwdriver</h3>
Cordless screwdrivers are smaller, lighter, and less expensive. They allow you to insert and remove smaller screws and even drill smaller pilot holes in softer materials.

A cordless drill driver is more powerful and can drill all types of holes in all types of materials, as well as to insert and remove bigger screws even in harder materials.
<h3>Drill Driver vs Impact Driver</h3>
Cordless impact drivers (also known as combi drills) are designed to be used in masonry, concrete, and brickwork - and they do it easily thanks to their hammer function. They are more powerful, heavier, and more expensive. This extra power also means they can easily damage softwoods.

A cordless drill driver allows you to work with softer and harder materials alike, as well as inserting and removing screws.
<h3>Corded Or Cordless?</h3>
The obvious advantage of corded drills is never running out of power, as well as never having to wait for batteries to charge.

The obvious advantage of cordless drills is the convenience of taking them anywhere without depending on extension cords (and the tripping risk), finding power outlets, and so on.

In a cordless drill, power and torque is determined by the voltage. Higher voltage also commands higher weight. So, if you need more juice in your cordless drill, such as 18V or 20V and upwards, then your tool will weigh just as much as a corded tool. Smaller batteries such as 12V or 14.4V are lighter.

18V tools are great for home use and DIYers because they are the most versatile, strong, and offer a good balance of weight and power output.
<h3>Picking A Chuck</h3>
Chuck is the part that holds the bits in the drill. You should pay attention to both the size and the type of chuck.

You will most frequently see chuck sizes in 1/4", 3/8", and 1/2" in diameter. 1/2" chucks allow you to use large drill bits.

As for chuck types, you can have them either keyed or keyless:
<ul>
 	<li>A keyed chuck simply means you will use a mechanical key to loosen or tighten drill bits. The main advantage here is that drill bits are held tighter.</li>
 	<li>A keyless chuck tightens the drill bit when you power the drill while hold the chuck with your hand. The advantage here is that changing bits is faster, plus there is no chuck key to lose in the middle of a job.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Desirable Features</h3>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Reverse mode</strong>, so you can remove stuck drill bits. Keyless chucks always have reverse mode (because this is how you get the drill bit out), so you have to look for this feature only if you are buying a keyed chuck drill.</li>
 	<li><strong>Variable speed</strong>, so you can use your drill to drive screws. This is also useful for drilling cleaner holes in different materials, which requires different bit speeds. Softer materials require higher speeds. Harder materials need lower speeds.</li>
 	<li><strong>Two speed ranges</strong> are especially important for driving screws. The lower speed range simplifies the task of driving screws without stripping them.</li>
 	<li><strong>LED work light</strong>. This is a small detail that you will thank when you are working in a dark place.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Battery And Tool Storage</h2>
Even when your tool is off, it still draws a tiny amount of energy from the battery, which adds up over days and weeks without use. The best course of action is to remove the battery from the tool when putting them away.

Also, avoid storing or charging the batteries in a place with extremely high or low temperatures:
<ul>
 	<li>High heat ruins your batteries permanently.</li>
 	<li>Cold weather decreases the amount of power available for your tool.</li>
</ul>
Also, <strong>avoid using the batteries to full discharge</strong>. Sometimes you will not be able to recharge your battery and you will permanently lose it. Most batteries today also offer a charge indicator, so you can avoid running your batteries down fully and damaging them.
<h3>Li-Ion, NiMH, NiCd, ABC, What?</h3>
Most batteries today are <strong>Lithium Ion (Li-Ion)</strong>, which offer more power, less weight, no battery memory problems, are lighter, and contain less metal elements harmful for the environment.

Avoid the cheaper <strong>Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH)</strong> and the <strong>Nickel Cadmium (NiCd)</strong> batteries – Cadmium is a toxic metal that can pollute ground water if it is not disposed correctly.

<strong>Caring for Li-Ion batteries is simple</strong>. Keep them cool. The hotter they become, the higher your chances are of facing battery failure.

One note on battery chargers: many brands also offer smart chargers, which can recharge a battery in 15 minutes to one hour, versus three to five hours of the conventional chargers.
<h3>Use The Same Batteries In Other Cordless Tools</h3>
And a final note on choosing a brand: if you decide on a battery size and a brand, then you will be able to share the same batteries and charger among all your cordless tools.

This way you can save money on buying (and garage/shop space on storing) extra batteries and chargers.
<h2>And Finally</h2>
Let me know in the comments below if I did something wrong, if you want me to add another kit that I didn't feature in the table above, or anything really that you want to talk about. I read and reply to all comments. Thanks for reading!]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Nick, thanks for the question.

I didn't consider them when I was writing the post because I compared only 18V tools. 19.2 and 20V are included here because the difference in these cases is just a marketing thing. On torque alone, the Kobalt looks like a valid choice as well.

Here's my suggestion to you: if you are considering to buy a new tool and it's your first cordless tool, make sure to look at the rest of the tool lineup and see what other tools you might be interested in buying in the future. This way, you can use the same batteries and save space + money on buying bare tools.

Best, D.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Just so you understand where I am coming from, my MBTI personality type is INTJ. I am extremely rational and I do my best to make sense of everything around me that is minimally important.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As I became interested in DIY and woodworking, I began to research hand tools and power tools. Then I saw myself comparing cordless tool kits, and I realized it was like trying to compare cell phone plans. Since each company offers a different amount of minutes, messages, and internet traffic, it is basically impossible to compare apples to apples.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">So I decided to draw a table with my research. And then I decided to post it online. And now you are here.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4uRofQmizvc?rel=0" width="448" height="252" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe>

One of the most important features of a drill/driver is torque, or how much power the tool delivers at the clutch. Most companies present their torque figures in inch-pounds force (US) or in Newton meters (metric).

Except DeWalt and Porter-Cable.

These two special snowflakes release their torque output numbers in UWO, or "Unit Watts Out".

I did what any geek would do: I found <a href="https://www.protoolreviews.com/buying-guides/max-watts-out/13109/" rel="nofollow">a guide</a> and converted all numbers to the same standards. This link is super long-winded but to save you the read, here is the short version:

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-671" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/560-vertical-167x250.jpg" alt="" width="167" height="250" />Torque (in.lbs) = MWO x 560 / Speed (RPM)

For example:
<ul>
 	<li>DEWALT Drill-Driver Kit DCD771C2 = 300 MWO x 560 / 450 RPM = 373.34 in.lbs</li>
 	<li>DEWALT Drill-Driver Kit DCD780C2 = 350 MWO x 560 / 600 RPM = 326.67 in.lbs</li>
 	<li>PORTER-CABLE Drill Driver Kit PCCK600LB = 330 MWO x 560 / 400 RPM = 462 in.lbs</li>
</ul>
Converting between Newton Meters and Inch-pounds Force is much simpler, just divide your in.lbs by 8.8507 and you get the Nm figure.

If you are interested in finding these and many more comparisons, in my <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-drill-driver-kit/">OBJECTIVE Cordless Drill-Driver Kit Comparison</a> you can find a big table containing torque figures in both in.lbs and Nm, plus many more details about 20+ drill/driver kits.

		<title>OBJECTIVE Cordless Circular Saw Comparison (UPDATED 2019)</title>
		<link>http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-circular-saw/</link>
		<pubDate>Sat, 26 Jan 2019 08:26:12 +0000</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[Diogo]]></dc:creator>
		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://bestlife52.com/?p=701</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While a circular saw is primarily seen as a construction tool, it has many uses in <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/">home improvement</a> and woodworking. A circular saw gets used for almost everything -- home building, making kitchen cabinets, putting up fences, and so on. Such versatility makes it one of the first purchases a woodworker will make.

In <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/new-hobby-woodworking/">woodworking</a>, circular saws are mostly used for breaking down heavier sheet goods (plywood, MDF, OSB) into smaller and lighter pieces that are easier and safer to handle on the table saw.

Cordless circular saws are even better because <strong>you can bring the tool directly to the workpiece -- no matter where it is</strong>. Imagine you are working on a roof, building a deck, or out by your fence and you don't want to or simply cannot drag a cord. They have two main advantages:
<ul>
 	<li>there is no need to untangle your extension cord, plus there is no power cord getting in the way of the cut.</li>
 	<li>you can own a smaller saw, which means more control over the tool and less user fatigue on arms and wrists.</li>
</ul>
Since many people will prefer to choose a circular saw belonging to the same battery system they already own, today I chose to compare only bare tools. Without further ado, let's get to it:
<h2>(Bare Tool) Cordless Circular Saw Comparison Table</h2>
[table id=15 responsive=collapse /]
<h2>How To Read This Table</h2>
Here are the main features you should consider when choosing a cordless circular saw.
<h3>Blade Size</h3>
Blade replacements for 7-1/4 inch saws are much easier to find. 6-1/2 inch blades have less options, and other measurements are even harder to find.

On the other hand, smaller saws are lighter, smaller, and give a better sense of control and comfort. They can make a lot of sense if you will make most of your cuts with sheet goods. You should opt for a bigger saw if you work with thicker construction lumber such as two-bys.
<h3>Power And Weight</h3>
In cordless tools more power usually means more weight due to the motor and the extra capacity battery.

Motor and battery technology has been constantly improving dramatically over the past decade. Brushless motors are more efficient because they have no carbon brushes to create friction and they are worthwhile in circular saws.

And note: the difference between Brushed and Brushless motors goes beyond marketing: brushless tools get better run-time and increased power, while also being lighter and lasting longer.

As for batteries, current lithium-ion technology is lightweight, making current cordless tools more compact and nimble. Lower capacity batteries make the tool lighter and easier to use, and higher capacity batteries give you more run time with less pauses for changing or recharging batteries. In other words, your final choice here depends on what type of use you plan on making.
<h3>Weight With Battery</h3>
The lighter the saw is, the more you feel like it is an extension of your hands. This is important for making a controlled and accurate cut.

The extra weight and power usually demand more experienced hands to handle the saw in operation, so take that into consideration when choosing a model for you.
<h3>RPMs And Noise</h3>
Higher RPMs help you cut through harder materials, and also tend to be noisier.

While you should always wear Personal Protection Equipment when operating power tools, noise numbers are also an important figure to consider when buying your new tool.
<h3>Depth Of Cut</h3>
While most circular saws use blades with the same dimensions, in practice their cut capacity varies slightly among brands.

Also consider that cut capacity is smaller at 45° when comparing with a straight 90° cut.

And a final note: most manufacturers recommend setting the cut depth at 1/4 inch deeper than the material, so take that into consideration when choosing your saw.

In practice, <strong>you need at least 1-3/4 inches in depth if you plan to cut two-by material</strong>. While most saws offer that and more for 90° cuts, pay attention to the depth of cut at 45°.
<h3>Bevel Capacity And Positive Stops</h3>
The vast majority of your cuts will be straight at 90°.

Most saws will bevel to at least 45°, and some higher-end models will bevel even further.

As for positive stops, most models have positive stops for 45° cuts, and some will also offer a 22.5° stop as well.
<h3>Left Or Right Blade</h3>
Traditionally most circular saws have blades on the right side.

That design allows the majority of users (right-handed) to perform smaller crosscuts and have the tool riding the board, while the off-cut falls to the right of the blade. On the other hand, this design makes life complicated when ripping wider panels.

Some manufacturers started designing blades on the left because they claim this design offers a better line of sight for operating your circular saw.

More traditional woodworkers simply prefer to go around to the other side of the panel and continue the cut by pulling the saw on longer cuts, instead of reaching further all the way from the same side.

In my opinion, it is purely a matter of preference, but you might think differently.
<h3>Blade Brake</h3>
This feature reduces your downtime waiting for the blade to stop before you restart your next cut, which increases your productivity.
<h3>Battery Gauge</h3>
Would you like to climb up the stairs and find out at the roof that your battery is low on charge?

Good cordless tool systems should allow you to check for charge at the battery itself, this way you can always have fully charged batteries and increase your productivity.
<h3>Work Light</h3>
This is a featured favored by older-- I mean, more experienced woodworkers and tradesmen. More light favors the tired eyes.

Lights also help to follow the cutting line in low-lit working conditions.
<h2>What About You?</h2>
If you made it this far, I hope I have helped you make an informed decision. If you have anything to ask me, or if I have incorrect data somewhere on this page, please feel free to leave a comment below -- I read and answer all of them.

Thanks!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>How To Use A Table Saw PROPERLY (detailed photos, jigs, &amp; instructions)</title>
		<link>http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/table-saw-jigs-instructions/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[From safeguarding your fingers to creating finger joint jigs — getting better acquainted with your “big saw.”

Your table saw is (choose one):

<ol>
<li>A convenient place to set my coffee mug while I work.</li>
<li>A great tool for turning 2x4s into 2x2s.</li>
<li>A machine I used a lot — until it launched a board through my garage wall.</li>
<li>The next tool I'll purchase.</li>
<li>A versatile saw I have mastered totally and completely.</li>
</ol>

Unless you chose the last one, read on.

Like most workshop warriors, you probably know how to rip a board to width on your table saw. But perhaps you haven't explored its other talents: creating woodworking joints, cutting grooves, mitering corners, mass-producing parts and cutting plywood.

The table saw can do all this and more, provided it's accurately adjusted, used safely and is operated with the proper know-how.

I’ll explore this great tool by answering some common (and not so common) questions about table saws.

<h2>What This Article Is And Isn’t About</h2>

I presume you know the basics:

<ul>
<li>how to cut boards to width (rip) using the rip fence, and</li>
<li>how to cut boards to length using the miter gauge.</li>
</ul>

I also presume you’ve developed a few sloppy work habits, maybe let your saw drift out of accuracy, and perhaps have begun thinking of it as a “one trick pony.” I’ll try to freshen your memory, review some basic tune-up and safety procedures, plus show you some new jigs and uses.

If you go right now to Amazon, there are 38 books devoted solely to table saws. There are accessories that can turn your table saw into a disc sander or molding cutter, and jigs that will help you create dovetail joints and perfect circles. I can't possibly cover everything here.

Bear in mind, every type of saw is different, Some blades tilt left, others tilt right (some saws even have a table that tilts around a fixed blade). There are miniature "hobby" saws with 3-1/2 in. diameter blades and commercial varieties with blades 12 in. and larger.

I urge you to locate and review your owner's manual; it will be more specific when it comes to the adjustments I describe below, and will also cover safety tips, maintenance, and accessories particular to your saw. Google your saw’s make and model if you can’t find the paper manual, chances are there’s a PDF somewhere on the internet.

<h2>How do I get my table saw to cut straight and square again?</h2>

Start by conducting the simple test you see in Figs. A, B, and C.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/table-saws-fig-a-mark-x-and-make-the-cut.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="608" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1845" />

Make an “X” on a 1x3 or 1x4, then cut it in half using the miter gauge as a guide (Fig A).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/table-saws-fig-b-blade-isnt-square.jpg" alt="" width="513" height="403" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1846" />

Flip one half over (Fig. B), butt the two cut ends together and view them from the side. If there’s a wedge-shaped gap where the cut ends meet, your blade isn’t square to your tabletop.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/table-saws-fig-c-miter-gauge-isnt-square.jpg" alt="" width="605" height="547" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1847" />

Keep the blocks in the same position, place a carpenter’s square along with their edges (Fig. C). and view them from the top. If you see wedge-shaped gaps, your miter gauge isn’t square to the saw blade.

You can readjust your saw to correct these and other problems, but first, check to make sure the blade is parallel to the miter gauge slots. It should be unless your saw’s been moved or banged around a lot, but check this first or some of the other adjustments will be useless.

Unplug the saw (as you should for all major adjustments) and crank the blade to its full height. Measure from the front and back of the blade over to one of the miter gauge slots.

If the measurements aren’t identical, loosen the bolts on the underside of the table that secure the blade “cradle” or carriage. then slightly reposition it. On saws with four bolts, loosen three of them and use the other as a pivot point. Consult your owner's manual for the specific steps.

<h3>How Do I Adjust My Table Saw Blade?</h3>

<strong>With the blade angle degree scale (usually on the front of the saw) set at "0” and the blade cranked to full height, rest one leg of a square on the table and the other 1/16 in. away from the blade. Sight between the square and body of the blade.

If you see a wedge, rather than a straight line, of daylight between blade and square, adjust the screw that stops the blade in the perpendicular position. On the Delta saw pictured here, this is a little hex screw on the table top.

Once the blade is perpendicular, readjust the arrow on the blade angle scale to "0” degrees. This is usually done by loosening a small screw and moving the pointer slightly. On some saws, you simply bend the pointer.</strong>

<h3>How Do I Square My Table Saw Miter Gauge?</h3>

<strong>Rest one leg of a carpenter’s square against the blade, the other against the miter gauge (loosen the locking handle of the gauge first). If the arrow on the gauge doesn’t point to “0,” loosen the screw that secures the pointer, move it to the “0” position, then retighten the screw.</strong>

<h3>How Do I Adjust My Miter Gauge To A Snug Fit In My Table Saw Slot?</h3>

<strong>If the gauge wiggles side-to-side in the slot, remove it and dimple one edge with a center punch in a zigzag pattern. Deepen each dimple until it fits snugly. If this creates too tight a fit, flatten the dimples with a metal file until the gauge slides freely, but firmly, in the slot.</strong>

<h3>How Do I Align My Table Saw Rip Fence?</h3>

<strong>Position the fence next to one of the miter gauge slots and lock it in position. If it doesn’t align itself parallel to the slot, loosen the two fence bolts or screws, realign the fence, then retighten the bolts or screws.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/table-saws-04-rip-fence-alignment.jpg" alt="" width="522" height="538" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1829" />

<h3>How Do I Adjust My Table Saw Blade Guard?</h3>

<strong>Place a square alongside the blade and splitter. Use a hand screw-type clamp to gently bend the splitter in line with the blade. For major adjustments, add or subtract a washer where the guard fastens to the saw.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/table-saws-05-blade-guard-adjustment.jpg" alt="" width="523" height="540" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1830" />

<h2>I give up. Which table saw blade should I buy?</h2>

Yeah, it's a jungle out there. When you go shopping, consider:

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/table-saws-06-which-blade.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="508" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1831" />

<h3>Blade And Tooth Composition</h3>

Steel blades are inexpensive but need to be replaced or re-sharpened frequently. They dull quickly when cutting particle board or tough woods like oak and birch.

A sharp steel blade can cut softwoods as cleanly as a carbide-tipped blade, but the advantages of carbide are overwhelming.

Carbide-tipped blades last 50 to 60 times longer than steel blades. They can cut particle board, hardwoods, plastic laminates, even some metals.

Carbide teeth come in varying qualities; you’ll get what you pay for.

<h3>Blade Thickness</h3>

Carbide blades are available in standard and thin-kerf styles. Thin-kerf blades remove less wood per cut and create less drag on a motor — making them a good choice for the less powerful, benchtop-type saws.

On the downside, thin-kerf blades tend to become distorted when hot and have shorter lifespans than standard blades.

<h3>Number And Pattern Of Teeth</h3>

Saw blades will have anywhere from 20 to 100 teeth, arranged in any number of ways, with a variety of tip angles and bevels.

<ul>
<li>For cutting boards to length or mitering across the grain, use a blade with 60 or more teeth.</li>
<li>For ripping boards to width, where speed is more important than smoothness, use a blade with fewer teeth.</li>
</ul>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Combination-Blade-Freud-Diablo-D1050X.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1823" />

<p class="box">My advice for the do-a-little-of-everything homeowner is to buy this Freud Diablo D1050X. It’s a great 50-tooth tungsten carbide combination blade; it has 10 groupings of 5 closely spaced teeth (for crisp cross-cuts) separated by a larger gap (for easy ripping). <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00008WQ2Z/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow"> The Amazon price offers great benefit for its low cost, click here and check it out yourself.</a></p>

<p class="box">If you own a benchtop saw, buy a thin-kerf blade such as the Freud LU83R010. The thin kerf requires less power from your saw and allows for faster feed rate as well. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00020JOAA/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">This blade has great Amazon reviews, click here and read them yourself.</a></p>

<h2> How much time should I spend fiddling around with blade guards, push sticks and other safety stuff?</h2>

Well, how long does it take your fingers to grow back?

<strong>The table saw is one of the most dangerous tools in the workshop</strong>; accidents multiply when people remove guards and take risks.

Being cut by the blade and getting hit by kicked-back boards are the two most obvious dangers.

But stay alert to another frequent creator of accidents — boards that are wet or green, twisted, bowed, or contain splits and loose knots. Such boards are more likely to pinch the blade, wedge against the rip fence and kick back unpredictably.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/table-saws-07-safety-guard-927x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="615" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1832" />

<h3>Actions To Protect Your Fingers</h3>

Protect your fingers by following these precautions:

<ul>
<li>Set your blade so it protrudes only about 1/4 in. above the wood being cut (Photo 7). Some pros swear that setting their carbide-tipped blades so the entire tooth clears the work produces a cleaner cut — but that should be the limit. Setting the blade higher exposes more of it for potential accidents, creates more strain on the blade and motor, and leaves a rougher cut.</li>
<li>Use your blade guard. Most guards contain three safety features: the “plastic shroud,” which keeps fingers away from the blade and prevents splinters or loose knots from flying back at you; the “splitter,” which keeps the cut open after it passes the blade to prevent pinching; and the “anti-kickback pawls” (shown in Photo 7), which have little teeth that allow the board to pass in the cutting direction, but bite into it in case it tries to kick back. If you remove the guard for dadoing (Photo 12) or some other operation, replace it as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Use a push stick (Photo 8) any time your fingers must pass within 4 in. of the blade. Push sticks (Fig. D) help you hold thin boards flat against the table surface while they’re sawn. Buy or make your push sticks (it’s an ideal way to use up scrap material) but by all means, use them. Keep them handy — in your back pocket or on the opposite side of the rip fence from the blade.</li>
<li>Use common sense. Never reach over a spinning blade. Don’t wear loose clothing. Unplug the saw when making adjustments or changing blades.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How To Avoid Kickback On The Table Saw</h3>

"Kickback," another real danger, occurs when the part of the board between the fence and blade gets pinched (or drifts away from the fence as you're cutting) and the blade, spinning toward you, catches it and hurls it back at you.

The anti-kickback pawls don't always prevent this, especially if the wood is very hard or you’re cutting skinny strips. The best defense is to stay out of the path of any possible kickback.

Use push sticks to extend your reach. Featherboards (Photo 12) also help prevent kickback.

“Outfeed rollers” help support long boards, stifling your impulse to reach over the blade to catch long boards as they fall off the table at the end of a cut.

This should go without saying: <strong>always</strong> wear <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/eye-protection/">sight</a> and <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/hearing-protection/">hearing protection</a>, and use a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/respirators/">dust mask</a> when cutting pressure-treated wood.

<h2>What do featherboards do? Can I make them?</h2>

Featherboards are basically fingers of wood, used to press boards firmly against the rip fence. They can also be clamped to a wood auxiliary fence (Photo 12) to hold boards down against the table saw’s surface.

Since featherboards take the place of fingers, they also minimize accidents; especially important when blade guards are removed. Made and secured properly, they create a one-way door, allowing boards to pass in one direction (forward), but preventing kickback. Featherboards always must be clamped firmly, immovably in place.

You can buy featherboards from woodworking stores for cheap or make them yourself as I show below.

<strong>Cut short slits (kerfs) into the end of a 5/4-in. thick hoard that’s been cut to a 45- to 60-degree angle. Keep the back of the board pressed firmly against the rip fence while cutting.</strong>

<strong>Adjust the rip fence. Turn off the saw, move the fence over the thickness of the 3/8-in. spacer (one 1/4-in. finger plus a 1/8-in. kerf). Then retighten the fence, back the board out and make the next cut.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/table-saws-12-featherboards.jpg" alt="" width="507" height="464" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1835" />

<strong>Featherboards help hold the workpiece firmly against both the fence and the table top, a great safety feature during operations like dadoing where the blade guards must be removed.</strong>

<h2>How can I make a simple table saw fingerjoint jig?</h2>

Fingerjoints — sort of a simplified dovetail. Their strength and simple beauty make them a natural choice for furniture, boxes, and drawers.

The jig you use is simple and cheap to build and can be used over and over. To make and use this jig, you’ll need to use a dado blade and remove the blade guard, so use extreme caution.

The key is making the alternately-spaced fingers and notches exactly the same width. You can make them any width you want; this project used 1/2 in.

With a 1/2-in. dado blade stack (set 1/2 in. high) I used the miter gauge to guide a 1x3 over the dado blade to create a 1/2-in. x 1/2-in. notch (Fig. E).

Then I glued a 1/2-in. x 1/2-in. x 2-in. “pin” into this notch.

I then raised the blade to 7/8 in. (slightly higher than the width of my 3/4-in. boards) and cut another notch exactly 1/2 in. away from the pin; then screwed the 1x3 to the miter gauge (Photo 13) in that exact position; most gauges have holes for this.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/table-saws-13-screw-box-joint-jig.jpg" alt="" width="627" height="588" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1836" />

<strong>Screw the jig to the miter gauge, making sure the 1/2-in. pin is exactly 1/2 in. away from the 1/2-in. dado blade.</strong>

Grab some scrap 1x6s or 1x8s for practice. Stand a scrap on end, bump one edge against the pin, then push the board with the jig and miter gauge across the dado blade to cut your first notch.

Leapfrog this first notch over onto the pin and cut your second notch; this will create a 1/2 in. wide notch exactly 1/2 in away from the first notch.

Repeat this over and over to create a series of fingers (Photo 14). Do this on another board, then interlock the two ends to check the fit; you may need to slightly reposition your 1x3 on the miter gauge.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/table-saws-14-cut-notches.jpg" alt="" width="515" height="471" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1837" />

<strong>Cut the notches by leapfrogging the most recently cut notch onto the pin, then cutting the next one.</strong>

On actual boxes, two of the sides will start with a finger, two with a notch (Photo 15), so make your first cut accordingly.

After you've glued your finger jointed box together and let it dry, use a power sander to remove the little finger ends that protrude past the corners of the box.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/table-saws-15-dry-assemble-and-test-fit.jpg" alt="" width="517" height="472" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1838" />

<strong>Assemble and check the test pieces for a tight fit. The jig may need to be slightly shifted in the miter gauge.</strong>

<h2>How Do I Use My Table Saw To Cut Plywood?</h2>

Plywood is unwieldy to cut on a table saw; it's heavy, sometimes warped and can be difficult to guide along the rip fence.

Use support tables and rollers (front, sides, and back) to help hold the wood.

When possible, first rough-cut the sheet about an inch oversize with a circular saw, then make the final cut on the table saw.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/table-saws-16-cut-sheet-goods.jpg" alt="" width="619" height="532" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1839" />

If you need to cut a sheet larger than your rip fence will allow, use the method shown above. A 2x4 cleat, temporarily screwed to the bottom side of the plywood, is guided along one edge of the saw’s table to create a straight cut.

By the way, always cut plywood and laminates “good side up” on a table saw; the blade tends to chip and splinter the bottom side.

<h2>Can I Cut 45-Degree Miters With My Table Saw?</h2>

Yep — at least moldings up to about 3 ft. long for picture frames or other projects. Longer pieces will be awkward to handle, require more room to maneuver and will be less accurately cut on a table saw — use a miter saw instead.

For an occasional cut, simply set your miter gauge at 45 degrees and hold (or clamp) your board against it as you guide it past the blade.

But for lots of cuts, the miter jig I show below is more accurate, easier to guide and always set to make common 45-degree cuts.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/table-saws-17-miter-sled-1-nail-platform-to-runners.jpg" alt="" width="561" height="475" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1840" />

<strong>Nail and glue a 3/8-in. particle board platform to two 3/8-in. x 3/4-in. runners resting in the miter gauge slots. Use the rip fence to position it square to the blade.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/table-saws-18-miter-sled-2-mark-two-lines.jpg" alt="" width="521" height="477" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1841" />

<strong>Mark two lines at a 45-degree angle to a slot cut in the platform by the table saw blade. <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/how-to-use-square/">Use a Speed square</a> to position the carpenter’s square for marking.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/table-saws-19-miter-sled-3-screw-cleats.jpg" alt="" width="522" height="503" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1842" />

<strong>Screw 1x2 cleats along the 45-degree lines using drywall screws. Paste wax the runners and platform to reduce friction between the jig and the table saw top.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/table-saws-20-miter-sled-4-cut-miters.jpg" alt="" width="521" height="504" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1843" />

<strong>Cut 45-degree miters by firmly gripping the molding and pushing the platform across the table and blade. Sandpaper glued to the cleats prevents the molding from slipping.</strong>

<h2>How can I quickly cut fifty 1/4-in. strips?</h2>

Cutting thin strips safely on a table saw is tricky since the blade guard usually prevents you from positioning the rip fence closer than an inch or so from the blade.

You can cut strips from the edge of the board farthest from the fence by adjusting the fence, ripping a strip, moving the fence in a little, ripping another strip, and so on — but it takes forever and the results aren't uniform.

The simplest solution is to build the jig I show. It’s simply a notched piece of plywood with a handle.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/table-saws-21-cut-thin-strips-safely.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="530" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1844" />

Adjust the fence so the distance between the edge of the jig and the blade is the width of the strip you want to be cut.

Then nestle the board in front of the notch and cut a strip; place the board back on the notch and rip again — and again.

The jig serves as a push stick and automatic spacer — and lets you keep your guard where it belongs.

<h2>Quick Trick #1: Create A Measuring Guide</h2>

Need to mass-produce a couple dozen checkers? 50 identical building blocks? A convoy of toy wheels?

<strong>Screw a 2x2 “stop block” to your rip fence to serve as an automatic measuring guide.</strong> Bump one end of your dowel or workpiece against the stop block, then use your miter gauge to move the dowel over the blade.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/table-saws-quick-trick-stop-block.jpg" alt="" width="534" height="493" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1849" />

You’ll get perfect, uniform pieces every cut (plus avoid the inevitable kickback that would result if you were to guide the end of the piece directly along the rip fence as you cut).

To adjust the length of your pieces, move the rip fence left or right.

<h2>Quick Trick #2: How To Protect Your Table Saw Surface</h2>

A twice-a-year wax job will protect the surface of your table saw from moisture and rust. As an added bonus, waxing it will reduce friction and help boards glide more easily across the top.

Lower the blade, then remove the blade guard, rip fence, and miter gauge. Apply a high-quality paste wax, let it dry, then buff thoroughly.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/table-saws-quick-trick-apply-paste-wax.jpg" alt="" width="514" height="423" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1848" />

Try it — you'll be amazed.

<h2>Quick Trick #3: Take Care Of Your Jigs</h2>

Most jigs, push sticks and featherboards are simply scraps of wood turned into something useful. To make certain I don’t toss them out with other scraps, I paint them with colorful paint. It protects them, helps me locate them, plus makes me think of them more as real tools.

Some woodworker folks glue small magnets to the push sticks and jigs they use most often and stick them to the side at their table saw — they’re out or the way but always ready to use.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>3 Solutions For Wet Basements (With Costs)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There aren’t many house problems more frustrating or upsetting than <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/why-is-my-basement-damp/">water in the basement</a>. Whether it’s water dribbling through your foundation, standing puddles or worse, it’s a nuisance and a mess.

But you know what? <strong>You can have a dry basement.</strong>

Sometimes the problem is easy to fix and you can make the repair yourself; other times the problem and the fix are quite complicated and you need to call in a professional. Some of the repairs are fairly inexpensive; others can run into big bucks.

But no matter what you decide to do, a dry basement brings peace of mind. And as far as I'm concerned, that’s worth every dollar. You see, at one time (yes, it's tough to admit) I was a wet-basement homeowner.

If your home is built on a slab or has a crawl space, you should still read this article. Why? Because I bet you know someone who has had water in their basement. So, read the information and pass it along to someone who needs it. They'll thank you for it!

<h2>Choosing The Correct Wet Basement Repair</h2>

Drying up a wet basement can be one of the trickiest repairs to make to a house because you need to determine how and why the water is getting in before you can stop it. And the cause isn't always obvious.

Begin by looking at the material that was used to construct your basement walls, either concrete block or poured concrete. (In this article, I’m skipping over the all-wood foundations now available.) The wall material determines the type of repair you can make.

For that reason, the story is divided into three sections; each section illustrates a progressively more complicated repair. These are the most widely used repair methods no matter what region you live in.

By the way, I won’t be discussing the use of waterproofing paint or hydraulic cement; my focus is on water problems that require more complex solutions.

The first repair shown, installing <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/gutters/">gutters</a> and sloping your yard away from the foundation, can be made to a home with either type of basement wall material.

The second repair, installing interior drain tile, can be done only to homes with concrete block walls.

The third repair, exterior drain tile, is for homes with poured concrete walls. This fix is also the one to choose if your home has block walls and you don't want to disturb the interior.

Each section tells you when you can make the repair or when it’s time to call a professional, along with the estimated costs and how long it’ll take you or a professional to complete the project.

<h2>The Easy Stuff – Gutters And Grade</h2>

If your home has block walls and the top one-third of the wall is wet after a heavy rain, this fix will probably do the trick. Water that pools on the ground near your home's foundation and soaks into the soil can seep into your basement.

Start by examining the edge of the roof and the landscaping around the foundation. If your house doesn't have gutters, downspouts, and extensions (a section of downspout that directs the water away from the house), the rain that runs off the roof has nowhere to go but straight down from the roof to the ground right next to the foundation.

Couple that with a grade that slopes toward the foundation and you're bound to have water problems sooner or later.

Begin by installing gutters, downspouts, and extensions (Fig. A).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fix-wet-basement-fig-a-gutters-and-grade-973x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="586" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1853" />

The extensions must move water away from the house to prevent it from soaking into the ground near the foundation.

<strong>Gutters cost around $5 a linear foot for either vinyl or metal (this includes all the necessary brackets and connectors, which are what drive up the per-foot cost).</strong> You can usually install them in one weekend. <strong>If you have them installed by a professional, you'll spend an additional $4 per linear ft.</strong>

Next, check the grade or slope around the foundation. The downward slope should be at least 6 in. for every 10 it. away from the house (Fig. A). If the slope is less than 6 in. or there’s no slope at all (inset to Fig. A), correct it.

A layer of water-impervious soil, such as clay, covered with topsoil and sod is the best way to shed water on a sloped area.

Once you’ve made both of these changes, you need to wait for the next heavy rain or two to see if they solve the problem. And in most cases, they will.

If they don’t, you'll need to consider making one of the more complex and expensive repairs described in the next two sections.

<h2>More Work, More Money – Interior Drain Tile</h2>

If your home has poured concrete walls, you can skip this section. But if your foundation is concrete block, read on.

This repair intentionally draws the water in through the blocks, channels it to a central location, and then pumps it outside.

Fig. B shows how it works.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fix-wet-basement-fig-b-interior-drain-tile-1018x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="560" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1854" />

The water is directed through weep tubes (short lengths of 3/4-in. diameter plastic tubing) inserted into holes drilled into each cavity of each bottom concrete block. This includes the cavity formed when the ends of two blocks are mortared together, and the corner joint cavities.

The weep tubes drain onto a drain tile pipe (a 4-in. diameter flexible plastic pipe with slits), which channels the water into a sump basket (3 large plastic barrel).

The sump pump, located in the sump basket, pumps the water up and out of the basement through a PVC pipe.

The PVC discharge pipe must extend far enough away from the foundation so that the pumped water will drain away from the house and not find its way back into the basement.

This repair can be done by a homeowner, but it’s very labor intensive.

You’d probably be better off hiring a pro. However, it's the best way to eliminate a water problem because it brings the water in at the wall's lowest point — where the block rests on the footing.

Here’s a quick overview of the steps involved with this installation:

First, you need to break up and remove a 12- to 14-in. wide section of the concrete floor where it meets the wall. Next, dig a trough around the basement's entire perimeter in the area you just broke up, all the way down to the bottom of the footing (inset to Fig. B).

Breaking up a concrete floor with a jack-hammer and hauling the old concrete and dirt out is slow, back-breaking work, especially if your basement is not a walkout and you have to carry the stuff up the steps.

Breaking up the floor with hand tools alone is out of the question, except for very large, very strong people with little else to do!

Next. you need to spread about a 2- to 3-in. layer of 3/4-in. rock in the trough you just excavated. Again, a slow, labor-intensive job.

Now, drill 3/4-in. diameter holes in every cavity of each block. These holes need to be flushed out with water (you use a garden hose) so the water you do invite into and through the block can flow freely into the weep tubes, which are inserted into the drilled holes.

Concrete blocks have either two or three empty cavities inside them and you need to know which type of block you have so that you can drill a hole into each cavity.

The easiest way to determine the number of cavities is to drill a hole in the center of one of the blocks along the bottom row (where you'll install the weep tubes). If you run into an obstruction, you've hit the center core of a two-cavity block. If you drill through easily, you’ve drilled into the empty center cavity of a three-cavity block.

Next. lay the 4-in. diameter continuous plastic drain tile (it's sold in 50-ft. or 100-ft. rolls) on the layer of gravel. Then you install the weep tubes into the holes in the block.

Now, spread a layer of 3/ 4-in. diameter rock over the drain tile you just put in — more lifting and hauling.

Finally, put down a layer of polyethylene film to cover the rock and weep tubes and then fill in the area with concrete (that you have to mix and haul) to finish the floor. Whew!

<strong>A professional basement waterproofing company charges $40 to $50 a linear foot to do the work. You can do it yourself for between $15 and $20 a foot—a savings of around 60%, but you'll pay for it with your time and effort</strong>.

The pros will also have the job done in two to three days. It could take you two to three weekends, weeks, months? Most professional installations also come with a guarantee.

Either way, interior drain tile is the best fix for homes with concrete block walls.

An alternative to interior drain tile is the interior water dam system (Fig. C).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fix-wet-basement-fig-c-water-dam.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="637" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1855" />

This type of system catches or traps water at the base of the wall on the existing basement floor, not below the floor at the footing. The enclosed channel then carries the water to a sump basket where it’s pumped outside by a sump pump.

<h2>For Professionals Only – Exterior Drainage System</h2>

If your basement walls are poured concrete. this is the repair you’ll need to make. It’s also the fix if the walls are concrete block and you don't want to tear up the basement floor.

With this repair, you prevent the water from getting to the foundation in the first place by using the correct type of fill gravel around the foundation and footings, filter cloth, exterior insulation, backfill, topsoil, and, finally, the correct slope.

I won't go into all the details of this procedure, because it's generally an expensive, “pros-only” repair. It's expensive because you need heavy equipment to dig up the soil around the foundation, all the way down to the house footings (often 8 it. below grade).

Once everything is excavated, you need to spread a layer of 3/4-in. rock and install the 4-in. drain tile pipe.

Onto the foundation, you install a rigid insulation board, polyethylene sheeting and a protective coating over the insulation board.

Then you fill the area with a granular (water-porous) backfill, so the water that does get through the layer of properly sloped sod and impervious topsoil (the next layer) will filter directly down to the drain tile (Fig. D).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fix-wet-basement-fig-d-exterior-repair.jpg" alt="" width="895" height="857" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1856" />

Be prepared for much of your yard to be torn up by the digging equipment. There’s just no neat, simple way to dig around a foundation without causing a great deal of damage to your lawn and landscaping.

It's expensive too. <strong>Plan to pay between $40 and $45 a linear foot just for the digging</strong>. New landscaping will add thousands of dollars to the final cost.

A contractor will complete a repair even this complex in less than one week. If you want to do the job yourself (after someone digs everything out), plan on it taking one month — minimum! Better yet, make this your only project for the summer.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ready to remodel? Here are the five key steps you need to follow when you tear out a wall.

Tired of your small, cramped kitchen or other room? Don’t despair. The extra space you always wanted may be only a wall away.

By removing a wall between two rooms, you can often create the larger, less confined living area that you want. You're not really increasing the size of your home, of course. It’s the feeling of spaciousness (or the ease of keeping an eye on the kids in the family room while you cook) that counts.

As you size up this project, keep in mind that your house has two kinds of walls; “non-bearing” walls, which support little weight, and “bearing” walls, which support a lot of weight,

Removing a non-bearing wall is easy since it doesn't affect the strength of your house. Nevertheless, be prepared to deal with electrical wires, pipes and heating ducts that might lurk inside the wall.

I'll discuss these problems below and in “Coping with Obstructions”. You'll need only basic carpentry skills and hand tools to remove the wall and repair the scars left in the ceilings and <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/new-hobby-woodworking/">woodwork</a>.

In contrast, removing a bearing wall takes more planning. You have to replace the bearing wall with a heavy beam to support the weight it carries. <strong>A mistake here could seriously weaken your home, so don’t take on this project yourself unless you've had some building experience.</strong>

And review your plans with your local building inspector, especially regarding the size of the beam you plan to install in place of the wall.

I’m going to show you the key steps for the more challenging project, removing a bearing wall, and replacing it with a beam. Ask your building inspector whether your wall is bearing or non-bearing when you apply for a building permit for this project.

<h2>Anticipate obstructions and plan around them</h2>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/how-to-remove-a-wall-1-anticipate-obstructions.jpg" alt="" width="914" height="956" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1864" />

Besides holding up the house, walls hide electrical wires, plumbing pipes, heating and cooling ducts, telephone wires, TV cables and more.

You’ll have to reroute everything you find around your new opening. Perhaps you can do some of this work yourself, but you might have to hire professionals as well.

That'll drive your project’s cost up, so try to figure out what’s inside the wall before you tear into it. You can then alter your plans if necessary before doing any damage.

To figure out what's inside, look for clues:

<ul>
<li>Receptacles and switches on either side of the wall are sure signs of electrical wires.</li>
<li>Telephone jacks and TV cable outlets mean additional wiring.</li>
<li>A register cover obviously indicates a heating or cooling duct.</li>
</ul>

If possible, check the wall from the basement or crawl space and also from above in the attic. Look especially for plumbing pipes, because rerouting them can be particularly difficult and expensive.

I won’t present detailed how-to information for running new electrical wires, plumbing lines and ductwork here, although for general guidelines, please read “Coping With Obstructions” section below. Sometimes this work is tricky, so don’t hesitate to call in pros to help figure out problems you can’t solve.

<strong>Tip</strong>: Rather than removing an entire wall, leave one or two stud spaces intact at one end, and create what’s called a “wing wall”. Use these stud spaces to reroute wiring, pipes. etc.

Once you’ve anticipated and planned for as many obstructions as you can, you're ready to shut off the electrical power at the main panel and strip the wallboard or plaster, keeping an eye out for the unexpected wire or plumbing vent.

This is dirty work, so seal off the work area with plastic and masking tape. And wear a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/respirators/">dust mask</a> and <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/eye-protection/">eye protection</a>.

Don’t remove any studs yet. At this point, reroute all wiring, pipes, and ductwork, calling on the pros as needed,

<h2>Erect Temporary Support Walls</h2>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/how-to-remove-a-wall-2-temprary-support-walls.jpg" alt="" width="866" height="948" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1865" />

Ceiling joists usually run at right angles over the top of a bearing wall. They support a lot of weight, so you’ll need to temporarily brace these joists while you tear out the studs that currently support them and permanently replace the studs with a beam,

Though it’s unusual, joists sometimes run parallel to a bearing wall. Check with your building inspector if you have any doubts.

To build temporary support walls:

<ol>
<li>Lay 2x4s (called “plates”) along the floor and ceiling about 3 ft. out from each side of the wall. You don’t have to nail the plates in place.</li>
<li>Then erect 2x4 studs between the plates. Line them up with the ceiling joists above.</li>
<li>Drive shims under the bottom end of the studs to wedge them upward and support the ceiling above.</li>
<li>Finally, toenail each end of the stud to a plate with two 8d nails.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Remove The Old Wall Studs</h2>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/how-to-remove-a-wall-3-remove-old-studs.jpg" alt="" width="863" height="677" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1866" />

With the ceiling firmly braced by the temporary walls, knock out the old wall studs with a 2-lb. sledge or a hammer.

If you want to reuse the studs, slide a reciprocating saw with a metal-cutting blade between the stud and the soleplate to cut the nails.

However, it’s not always worthwhile trying to reuse old lumber. It has usually become brittle with age and splits easily when you try to renail it.

Leave the old soleplate in place. You’ll use it later.

<h2>Prepare The Frame For The Beam</h2>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/how-to-remove-a-wall-4-prepare-frame-for-beam-1024x895.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="487" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1867" />

The new studs that you’ll put in to support the beam are called “trimmers.”

The longer the beam, the more weight the trimmers have to support. If your beam span exceeds 6 it, it’s recommendable that you use four trimmers, two at each end. This helps keep the beam from crushing at the point where it rests on the trimmers.

The illustration below shows two ways to install trimmers. On one side they are nailed inside an adjacent wall. That way they're out of sight, which will leave the finished wall smooth and uninterrupted.

At the other end, a short section of the old wall (a wing wall) was left. This approach is partly for looks. It emphasizes the transition from one room to the other, maintaining a sense of two separate rooms. But it's also practical because it’s a good place to reroute some of those wires and water pipes.

In either case, keep in mind one important framing principle: the trimmers should be supported continuously down to the foundation or to another beam (Details B and C). They can’t simply rest on the floor.

In Detail B the rim (or “band”) joist already supports one trimmer, so you only have to add one short 2x4 block to support the other.

In Detail C, a 2x4 block was nailed under each of them (and under the new stud too). The blocks rest on the solid beam.

<h2>Set The Beam</h2>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/how-to-remove-a-wall-5-set-the-beam-1024x790.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="430" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1868" />

This beam consists of two 2x12s spaced 1/2 in. apart and nailed together with 16d nails spaced every 16 in. along the edges. The 1/2-in. plywood spacer simply makes the beam 3-1/2 in. wide, the exact width of a 2x4 stud wall.

For longer spans, you have to use stronger beams. Consult your building inspector or a structural engineer to make sure your beam is strong enough and won’t sag. A full-service lumberyard will often provide this service if you buy your lumber there.

<ol>
<li>Ask a friend to help you lift the beam onto the set of trimmers, which you’ve already nailed in place at one end.</li>
<li>Use a trimmer at the other end to lever the beam into place, as the illustration shows.</li>
<li>Cut this second set of trimmers 1/8 in. longer than necessary to make sure the beam wedges up tightly.</li>
<li>The trimmer will slide along the old plate as you drive it in, but protect the end of the trimmer with a block so you don’t damage it.</li>
<li>Add the second trimmer and nail the assembly with 16d nails. You can now remove the temporary support walls.</li>
</ol>

Notice that this is a two-person project. Beams are heavy and dangerous when lifted overhead. One person should steady the beam while the other drives the trimmers into place.

To finish the project, saw off the old soleplate flush with the trimmers and repair the floor between the two rooms. If your floors are hardwood, you’ll be left with an ugly, difficult-to-repair gap.

You might have to hire a specialist to make the two floors blend. 
Then cover the framing with drywall and woodwork to match the decor of the rooms.

<h2>Coping With Obstructions</h2>

<h3>How Do You Reroute Electrical Wires?</h3>

Almost every wall contains electrical wiring, but if you’re experienced in wiring procedures, it’s relatively easy to move. 

Trace the wires back to their nearest electrical box and disconnect them there before removing them. (Be sure to turn off the power at the main panel first.) Then, if necessary, reroute the wires around the wall opening, using new wiring, connectors, staples and other materials.

Wiring can get tricky, so if you’re unsure about how to do it correctly, hire a licensed electrician. And be sure that your local electrical inspector checks the work before you close up the walls again.

You'll probably have to break open additional walls to gain access to some boxes and properly connect wires. One advantage of hiring a licensed electrician is that he knows how to minimize the damage to other walls, so you won’t be left with a lot of repair work.

Never simply cut wires and leave them hanging inside the wall.

<h3>How Should I Reroute Plumbing?</h3>

Moving plumbing will be more challenging. You could find any of three types in the wall:

<ul>
<li>water supply lines,</li>
<li>drains, and</li>
<li>vents (which run up from the drains to open air).</li>
</ul>

A plumber can reroute supply lines and vents relatively easily. But expect to tear open additional walls and ceilings to provide access to new routes. Plumbing costs for these should be less than $800 if you do the wall tearing and repairing yourself.

Rerouting drainpipes can pose a bigger problem, because you’ll have to put more bends in the line, yet always keep the pipe angled downward to drain properly. And too many turns can result in clogged pipes in the future.

Discuss the options with a plumber. You might have to lower an entire ceiling or a section of it to hide a redirected drain.

If by a stroke of bad luck the wall holds the main drain (a 3- or 4-in. diameter pipe, called a “soil stack”), the price tag could easily reach $1,500. At this price, you might want to revise the original plan so you don’t have to move this pipe.

<h3>How Can You Reroute Heating And Cooling Ducts?</h3>

Removing an interior wall usually won’t affect a forced-air heating system, because most heating supply ducts run up exterior walls.

Of course, if you find a duct where you want to install a patio door, you’ll have to reroute the duct through another stud cavity.

However, the return air part of the system is usually installed in an interior wall. While you can sometimes block off this return air without hampering the effectiveness of the heating system, you’ll need professional advice to know for sure.

And if you have central air conditioning, you must maintain proper return air ducts, because they’re essential for effective cooling.

In any case, installing new ducts requires sheet metal working skills and tools and the know-how to balance airflows so all your rooms are comfortable. Unless you have this experience, call in a heating and cooling professional to help out.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Weekend Woodworking was a sister publication to Wood Magazine. During 9 years they have published projects that could be build using minimal tools, little time, and just a few materials.

They have gathered all the issues, transformed them in PDF form, and released a DVD, which is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004IM5XNK/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow"> available for sale at Amazon</a>. I have these projects and I am showing the first page of my 26 favorite plans here, so you can have an idea of what you could expect if you bought this bundle.

Why 26? Oh, that is such a simple answer. 52 weeks, so half the time you are in your shop making dust, and half the time you are thinking about all the cool things you will build when you get back to it!
<h2>High-Rise Basket – #05, page 12</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1913" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-005-pg-12-bandsaw-basket-780x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="731" />

Most people call it a collapsible basket, but some people also refer to it as a bandsaw basket, or a scroll saw basket – referring to the power tools used to make this basket.

No matter if you prefer <em>potaytos</em> or <em>potahtos</em>, it is hard to ignore the beauty and the practicality of the basket – after all, you can store it flat for storage by simply folding down the handle. You can also use it as a trivet or hang it on your wall as décor.

You can use a collapsible wooden basket at your home, campsite, RV, you name it. You can serve bread at your dinner table (or tailgating, camping, boating, picnicking), use it as a fruit basket,

All these uses are strong reasons that make this basket a great gift for friends and family alike.

Other than the tools themselves, remember you might need a special blade for the curved sections.

As for the woods you need, you have plenty of freedom in that department, because you can simply laminate a bunch of scraps together and make your own board. As a bonus, you reduce clutter and clean up your shop in the process.
<h2>Armored-Car Bank – #08, page 14</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1914" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-008-pg-14-piggy-bank-780x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="731" />

This is a super cool twist to the classic piggy bank. <a href="http://bestlife52.com/financial-independence/">Saving money and financial responsibility</a> are healthy habits that can be encouraged by simple actions.

While a Chinese piggy bank made of plastic can also achieve the same goal, a handcrafted toy made of wood can potentially become a family heirloom to be appreciated for many years to come.
<h2>Hot-Shot Clothes Tree – #15, page 18</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1915" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-015-pg-18-hot-shot-clothes-tree-780x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="731" />

This is another twist on a classic piece of furniture, this time it is the clothes tree with an inexpensive Nerf basketball kit. What I like the most about this project is how it can positively reinforce simple organization in your kid’s room, and tie it up with playing sports – much better than staying stuck the entire day on online games such as Fortnite.

This project uses oak for the post and plywood for the backboard. You will need a bandsaw to cut the legs to rough shape, a belt sander or a disc sander to sand them to the line, a doweling jig and a drill to attach the legs to the post, and a router to chamfer the post. For the plywood backboard, you can either repeat the bandsaw cutting and the belt sander to final shape the accurate lines or use a router jig and a stop block to create the half-circle shape for the backboard.
<h2>Alpine-Ride Action Toy – #16, page 10 &amp; #19, page 28</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1916" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-016-pg-10-alpine-ride-action-toy_vertical-wooden-car-track-778x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="733" />

Some people also refer to this toy as a click clack track, wooden vertical track, zig-zag racing set, or even as wooden ramp racer cars. There is something special to such a simple idea that can hypnotize children for hours on end.

Made of fir plywood (1/2”) and pine, this is an easy project that you can store flat by simply separating the tower track and the base. Cut the plywood to size with a table saw and use a tapering jig for shaping the tower sides. You can cut the plywood holes with a scroll saw, or a jigsaw – click here to read more about <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/can-you-cut-plywood-with-a-jigsaw/">cutting plywood with a jigsaw without splintering it</a>. The ramp pieces are assembled with a hot glue gun.

<strong>Make sure to follow the instructions on Weekend Woodworking #16, but get the revised dimensions from #19 on page 28.</strong>
<h2>King Arthur's Castle – #16, page 18</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1917" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-016-pg-18-king-arthur-castle-781x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="730" />

This is a project that makes for a great gift for collectors and History nuts – like myself.

The towers are made of maple turning squares, which you can also laminate from maple stock; the walls are made of maple plywood; and the gate parts, battlements, and drawbridge are made of maple boards.

And you know what is the coolest thing about this build article? The Toy Soldier Company is still in business and it is still owned by the same family since it began operating in 1984. Unfortunately, they do not have a retail store, but you can <a href="https://www.toysoldierco.com/">click here</a> (NOT an affiliate link) and buy your toy soldiers online.
<h2>Crumb-Box Cutting Board – #16, page 28</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1918" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-016-pg-28-crumb-box-cutting-board-for-kitchen-780x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="731" />

Build this project and be on the way to having a crumb-free kitchen countertop. This is a cutting board with a grate, with a splined box to catch crumbs. All parts can be made from one 1”x6” maple board, cherry for the splines, and finished with two coats of vegetable oil.
<h2>Big-League Organizer – #20, page 18</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1919" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-020-pg-18-big-league-baseball-gear-organizer-781x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="730" />

This is a wall rack for organizing your kid’s baseball gear – mitt, cap, bat, and ball. When everything has a place to go, it is easy and simple to keep a bedroom organized and instill good habits from a young age.

This project uses birch plywood for the diamond and birch stock for the shelf, as well a couple of Shaker pegs for the hooks – which can be easily found at any big box store.
<h2>Harbor Light – #21, page 10</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1920" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-021-pg-10-harbor-light-desk-lamp-778x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="733" />

This is certainly a different build! This desk lamp is a model of <a href="https://www.emcotterconservancy.org/">The Edward M. Cotter</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_M._Cotter_(fireboat)">America’s oldest working fireboat</a>, located in <a href="https://www.newyorkupstate.com/buffalo/2016/01/edward_cotter_fireboat_in_buffalo_where_to_find_it.html">Buffalo’s harbor</a> since 1900.

It is made of padauk and maple, so wearing a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/respirators/">dust mask</a> is a must when sawing and sanding parts because padauk might irritate your respiratory system.
<h2>Toddler Town Car – #21, page 20</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1921" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-021-pg-20-toddler-town-car-780x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="731" />

As I mentioned previously, Weekend Woodworking was a sister to <a href="https://www.woodmagazine.com/">Wood Magazine</a>. This project comes from an entry made to Wood Magazine’s first toy contest, 30 (!!) years ago.

Young children will love this project, especially the rattling sound coming from the 10 ping-pong balls inside the wheels. All parts are made of oak – one board measuring 3/4 x 9-1/4 x 48” for most parts and another board of 3/4 x 7-1/4 x 24” for the four wheels.
<h2>Shadow Box – #21, page 28</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1922" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-021-pg-28-farm-themed-shadow-box-778x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="733" />

This shadow box is themed after a farm, with a silo and a barn. It is a nice project to teach city kids that the milk does not come from the supermarket – unfortunately, I actually heard a child asking that to her mother.

The entire project, including the back, was made from a single board of clear white pine, dimensions 1/4 x 7-1/4 x 72”, however, you can also use other woods such as redwood, cedar, poplar, and so on. You can make animals and props yourself or buy miniatures.
<h2>Jewelry Case – #22, page 24</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1923" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-022-pg-24-jewelry-case-778x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="733" />

A reader sent this project to Weekend Woodworking. He was an industrial arts teacher in Chicago and perfected the design throughout 20 years of teaching it to his students.

The lid and the back being edge-jointed for saving some money on lumber. All parts are made of cherry, except the hardboard drawer bottoms. The box build instructions call for a table saw with dado blades and a router. The two hinges and the six knobs are made of brass.

One interesting finishing technique they teach in this article is how they use lye (sodium hydroxide) to bring out the reddish/brown cherry color, which is an interesting challenge by itself. Needless to say, it is a caustic product, so you need to read and follow carefully the container direction, as well as use proper <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/eye-protection/">eye protection</a>, gloves, and clothing.
<h2>Aromatic Red Cedar Coat Hangers – #25, page 10</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1924" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-025-pg-10-aromatic-cedar-coat-hangers-780x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="731" />

This is a practical gift that you can make by the dozens – simply group the operations. Cut your hanger blanks, make a dedicated jig for cutting the spline slot, cut your hook bending form, assemble, and you’re done!

Leave it unfinished if you want to preserve the cedar aroma, or apply something durable if you decide to use hardwoods such as walnut, maple, oak, and so on.
<h2>Organized-Cook's Companion – #26, page 22</h2>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1925" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-026-pg-22-organized-chef-recipe-box-779x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="732" />

In simple English, this is a recipe box that is also a bookshelf and a decorative furniture piece for your kitchen.

What I really like about this project are the two drawers that make the recipe box. Whenever my grandma was given a new recipe, she always wrote the name of the person who gave her the recipe. My own twist is to have the person write the recipe as well, for two reasons:
<ol>
 	<li>because I love seeing other people’s handwriting, just as much as I love listening to other people’s accents, and</li>
 	<li>with mobile phones, texting, computers, emails, we simply don’t handwrite anything anymore, not even a paper note, and I think that makes the world a little poorer of personal experiences.</li>
</ol>
For me, having a recipe box with handwritten recipes is closer to my heart than simply going to YouTube and searching for a video recipe – although I have to admit that going to YouTube is faster and more convenient.

Anyways, back to the build - the entire project can be made with one board of oak, with dimensions of 3/4 x 9-1/4 x 96”. You will make the straight cuts on a table saw, the rough curved cuts on the bandsaw, and sand these to the line with a belt sander.
<h2>Classic Spool Rack – #29, page 6</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1926" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-029-pg-06-spool-display-rack-779x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="732" />

This display rack holds 64 spools and it is a great addition to any sewing center.

The Federal-style frame uses simple mortise-and-tenon joinery, however, the upper dentils provide a different touch to the design and a challenge for expanding your woodworking skills.

You can also make slight changes to the frame design and build yourself a great mirror.
<h2>Two-Stepper Simplicity – #29, page 26</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1927" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-029-pg-26-shaker-step-stool-780x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="731" />

This Shaker step stool is based on an original 19th-century design. The sides are angled and contribute to the stool’s stability. The entire stool is made of poplar.

As an alternative, you could also close the back and the bottom of the stool and build yourself a small tool tote for carrying tools around the house for small repairs.
<h2>Christmas Tree Tray – #30, page 14</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1928" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-030-pg-14-christmas-tree-router-tray-781x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="730" />

This is a simple router tray that can add an extra layer of season’s décor while you entertain your guests.

The materials you will need are 1/2” plywood for the templates and a 2x10 pine for the tray itself. The tools you need for this project are a router, a bowl and tray router bit, and a coping saw or a scroll saw for removing the excess material from the templates and the blanks.
<h2>Jewelry Showcase Cabinet – #30, page 20</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1929" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-030-pg-20-jewelry-cabinet-781x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="730" />

This jewelry cabinet could have been designed by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mariekondo/">Marie Kondo</a> in 1992 because it approaches jewelry storage vertically and everything can be organized and found very quickly.

The necklace rack and the earring bar can be easily customized according to your own needs, so take these parts as more of an inspiration than anything else. In other words, you are more than welcome to look at what you want to place inside this cabinet and come up with your own storage solutions – which should challenge the interaction between your creativity and your <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/new-hobby-woodworking/">woodworking skills</a>.

All parts are made of 1/2” cherry, except for the hardboard back.
<h2>"Cow Palace" Toy Barn – #38, page 5</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1930" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-038-pg-05-cow-palace-toy-barn-779x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="732" />

This is probably due to being born and raised in a big city – the truth is that I can’t resist a project that promotes kids interacting with animals. This toy barn has a removable roof section and a wall that folds down, allowing kids to play inside it. The removable roof helps avoid small fingers getting pinched between the panels.

All parts are a 5x5 sheet of birch plywood, a 3/4" x 5-1/2” x 36” maple board, and 1/4" dowel stock for the pens and ladder. The windows and the shingles are routed using a template, while the barn doors are dadoed on your table saw.
<h2>Daredevil’s Delight – #42, page 20</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1931" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-042-pg-20-daredevil-delight-toy-biplane-780x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="731" />

This toy biplane will provide countless hours of fun for kids. The classic design surely invites the imagination to work! Its contrasting colors come from oak and walnut, laminated or resawn as per the plan’s description – plus a toy person or some maple for the pilot. The tools you will need are a table saw, a dado blade set, a bandsaw, a router table, and a drill press.
<h2>Off-The-Wall Fruit Trivets – #43, page 20</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1932" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-043-pg-20-decoration-with-trivets-780x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="731" />

I was born and raised in a developing country, where the bigger emphasis is on “function” rather than in “form.” As a young adult, I lived in Japan for 4 years for my Master’s Degree. If I had to choose one single element that changed my life in Japan, it would be how they manage to create highly beautiful and functional things.

This trivet project reminds me of that.

When in use, they fulfill its main task of reducing wear and tear in kitchen countertops and tabletops. When not in use, they have the right place to go back to and become part of the kitchen décor.

The trivets are made first and use maple stock. Then it’s time for the backboard, which uses cherry.
<h2>Tie Valet Foldaway Organizer – #45, page 22</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1933" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-045-pg-22-tie-valet-foldaway-organizer-780x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="731" />

This is another project that would go well with the Konmari organization method. Each tie is easy to find, each tie also has a dedicated place to go back to, and the valet uses very little space – only 4” from the wall in the folded position. All parts are oak, plus some dowels for the tie rack.
<h2>Earring Display – #45, page 24</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1934" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-045-pg-24-earring-display-778x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="733" />

This earring display uses few materials and makes for a great gift. The bars have different widths, so they can accommodate longer or shorter earrings. The entire build was designed to use only a single board of cherry, 3/4” x 7-1/4” x 48”, however, you can plan it around pieces from your scrap bin as well.
<h2>Four-Seater Children's Picnic Table – #46, page 20</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1935" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-046-pg-20-four-seater-kids-picnic-table-780x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="731" />

Although the picture suggests an indoors use in a playroom, the project calls for exterior-grade plywood for the tabletop and the seats and cedar for the base – so it is perfectly suitable for your backyard or patio.

All projects in these magazines come with the expected cutting diagrams, list of materials, and detailed instructions. This PDF also comes with full-sized drawings of the legs, tabletop supports, and crossarms on the final pages, so they are very beginner-friendly.

Even though this is a beginner-friendly project, they don’t call for a pocket-hole jig. You may like them or not, but one thing is for sure – this project, just as all the others I have selected for this list, will teach you actual, time-tested woodworking joinery and techniques, which will expand your knowledge and capabilities.
<h2>Dovetailed Jewelry Box – #48, page 26</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1936" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-048-pg-26-dovetailed-jewelry-box-780x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="731" />

This is a basic box, with all parts made from birds-eye maple. The dovetail slots are cut using a router table jig, and you will cut the dovetail blanks from walnut.

The dovetail jig can later be used for reinforcing basically any box or drawer you build in the future, so I would consider building the jig with good materials and quality plywood, as well as taking your time to line everything just right. The technique behind it is simple enough to make these machined dovetails a staple in your shop
<h2>Butcher's Chopping Block – #49, page 22</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1937" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-049-pg-22-butcher-shop-chopping-block-782x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="729" />

This is a downsized version of the old-fashioned chopping block from the butcher’s shop. It is entirely made of maple laminations and final dimensions are a 12” square, 6-3/4” high – the butcher block itself is 4” thick.

The magazine teaches a trick here to ensure the laminations don’t move while you are adding clamping pressure.

Remember to use Titebond II glue for your laminations, because it is food safe – <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=titebond+ii&amp;i=tools&amp;rh=n%3A228013%2Cn%3A13397711%2Cp_89%3AFranklin+International%7CTitebond&amp;dc&amp;crid=2WQB7ZB2UUBIQ&amp;qid=1551795003&amp;rnid=2528832011&amp;sprefix=lock+mit%2Caps%2C342&amp;ref=sr_nr_p_89_3/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">click here to find today’s discount</a>.
<h2>Perpetual Calendar – #50, page 22</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1938" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/weekend-woodworking-050-pg-22-perpetual-calendar-780x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="731" />

Landlines nowadays are closer to an internet broadband service provider, being rarely used. However, the perpetual calendar idea itself looks quite neat in my opinion. I am not a fan of that design where you slide a square and reveal the entire month, I think the extra numbers hanging on the sides are quite an eyesore.

I like this design instead with all the individual numbers that can be rearranged in any way you like. The upper board can be substituted with a whiteboard for a grocery list, or simply be scrapped altogether.

<p class="box">Remember you can buy the plans for these 26 selected projects, plus another 299 for a total of 325 projects <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004IM5XNK/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">available for sale at Amazon</a>.<br><img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Weekend-Woodworking-Projects-CD.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="587" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1941" /></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[No fancy joinery in this furniture, no complicated techniques. You don’t even need a table saw — just a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-circular-saw/">circular saw</a> and hand tools.

This outdoor furniture is just what you need to help you catch up on your relaxing this summer. Just imagine — summer afternoons, an ice-cold drink, cool shade and a comfortable wood chair that you built yourself. Plastic and metal just wouldn’t feel the same.

This furniture was designed so that you can build it even without the luxury of a home wood shop. There's no fancy joinery — most parts are just screwed together — so even if you don’t have a lot of tools, this outdoor set is easily within your grasp.

Each piece will take only a day or so for you to make — even if you’re a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/new-hobby-woodworking/">beginner to woodworking</a>.
<h2>What Wood To Use In Outdoor Furniture?</h2>
You have a number of choices:
<ul>
 	<li>Personally, I’d choose western cedar for its natural beauty and resistance to decay.</li>
 	<li>Cypress is another excellent choice if it’s available in your area.</li>
 	<li>Pine is good, but be sure to treat it with a preservative.</li>
 	<li>Pressure-treated pine will work, but you must seal it well with an oil-based stain or outdoor deck sealer to prevent irritation to the skin. You’ll also have to wait a couple of weeks for pressure-treated pine to dry sufficiently before you apply a finish.</li>
 	<li>Redwood is a good choice, but it’s expensive.</li>
</ul>
If you decide to use cedar, the boards may only be available smooth on one side and rough on the other. Your lumberyard or a local cabinet shop may be able to plane the rough side for you; if not, use a belt sander and a 36-grit belt to smooth the rough side.
<h2>Tools Needed And Material Costs</h2>
The only tools you need for this project are:
<ul>
 	<li>circular saw,</li>
 	<li><a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-drill-driver-kit/">drill and driver kit</a>,</li>
 	<li>tape measure,</li>
 	<li>steel square,</li>
 	<li>straightedge,</li>
 	<li>hammer, and</li>
 	<li>side cutter (a heavy wire cutter).</li>
</ul>
If you're a beginner with the circular saw, watch the video below for a better understanding on how to use it safely:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wrh7UpVxbhw" width="448" height="252" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

If you have a router, you can use it to round over some of the edges, but a simple wood file and sandpaper will work. If you don't have a combination pilot-and-countersink drill bit for No. 6 screws (35), <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/best-drill-bit-set/">pick one up</a> — you’ll be glad you did.

For gluing parts, I suggest you use construction adhesive or a water-resistant glue like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=titebond+ii&amp;i=tools&amp;rh=n%3A228013%2Cn%3A13397711%2Cp_89%3AFranklin+International%7CTitebond&amp;dc&amp;crid=2WQB7ZB2UUBIQ&amp;qid=1551795003&amp;rnid=2528832011&amp;sprefix=lock+mit%2Caps%2C342&amp;ref=sr_nr_p_89_3/?tag=bestlife52-text-20">Titebond II</a>. Also wear <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/eye-protection/">safety glasses</a> when cutting and nailing.

The lumber for this chair cost around $90, plus about $11 for screws, glue and nails. Total cost for the love seat was about $130, and the table was about $50.
<h2>Before You Start</h2>
Below you will find complete step-by-step directions for building only the chair.

To build the love seat and the table, use the respective plans, shopping and cutting lists, and the same techniques described for the chair.

If you haven't built anything in a while, you should reacquaint yourself with your tools. A few practice cuts with your circular saw will remind you if the blade is dull or if you’re cutting on the correct side of your marks.
<h2>Outdoor Chair</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1964" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/outdoor-furniture-fig-a-chair-788x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="724" />
<h3>Cutting List</h3>
[table id=36 /]
<h3>Shopping List</h3>
[table id=38 /]
<h3>Cutting All The Parts</h3>
Begin by cutting all of the pieces listed in the Cutting List, with the exception of parts G, S and T. These parts must be cut later to fit the chair when it's partially assembled.

Take particular care to cut the side slats (R) so they're exactly the same length. These slats have to fit against a rail (S), and any differences in the length of the slats will result in gaps.

While you’re sawing, cut the arms of the chair and love seat (Photo 1) with a 2-in. taper from front to back. When cutting parts E, F, and G, set the angle of your circular saw to 20 degrees.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1958" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/outdoor-furniture-1-cut-parts-with-circular-saw.jpg" alt="" width="602" height="586" />

<strong>Cut the chair parts with your circular saw. Make tapered cuts for the arms of the chair.</strong>
<h3>Start With A Simple Box</h3>
You can see from the photos (especially Photo 2) that the whole chair is built around a simple box, with the legs, seat and back all attached to it.

To start assembly, nail parts A together with 4d galvanized finish nails (Photo 2). Notice that the sides overlap the ends of the front and back boards.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1959" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/outdoor-furniture-2-nail-together-a-box.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="588" />

<strong>Nail together a box to begin the chair assembly. Nail through the sides and into the front and back pieces.</strong>

Each of the legs gets glued and screwed onto the box you’ve just built. The box overlaps each leg 1-1/2 in. and the top of the box is 14-1/2 in. from the bottom of the legs.

To make juggling these parts a little easier, try marking a line exactly where the box will go onto each leg.

To assemble these parts. lay the back legs flat on the floor and align the box with the marks on the legs. Drill pilot holes and glue and screw the box to the back legs, as shown in Fig. A

To finish attaching the legs, turn this assembly around and fasten the box to the front legs the same way.

Whenever you screw wood pieces together, always drill a pilot and countersink hole first (a combination bit is the best tool), to prevent splitting the wood.

To complete this part of the assembly, screw through each leg into the corners of the box as shown in Fig. A.
<h3>Attaching Arms And Seat Braces</h3>
The chair really starts to take shape when the arms get screwed into place (Photo 3). Be sure that each arm overhangs the front and back legs as shown in Fig. A. Predrill and then screw the arms into the legs.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1960" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/outdoor-furniture-3-screw-the-arms.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="591" />

<strong>Screw the arms to the tops of the legs after attaching the legs to the box frame.</strong>

Glue and screw on parts E, F, and H as shown in Fig. A Be sure that E, H, and J are screwed from the sides of the chair box as well as the front and back.

All this gluing and screwing may seem like overkill to you, but leaving screws and glue out of an area can put stress on other joints.

Next, measure and cut part G to fit between the back of the arms and onto F as shown below, then glue and nail G into E

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1961" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/outdoor-furniture-4-glue-and-nail-back-braces.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="589" />

<strong>Glue and nail the back brace between the arms. Seat and back supports are glued and nailed inside the box frame.</strong>

Now’s a good time to relax and inspect the work you’ve just completed. Look over the chair to make sure the legs are all in contact with the floor.

Clean off any glue that's oozing out of the joints, and check for any screws or nails that may have been left out — this is by far the easiest time to correct problems.
<h3>The Side Slats</h3>
These side slats give the chair its Mission style.

To install them, turn the chair upside down and cut the cleats (T) to fit under the arms, between the front and back legs (Photo 5). Glue and nail part T onto the underside of each arm, making sure it is 1-1/2 in. from the inside edge of the legs, just as the box was (Photo 5). The side of part T should line up with the side of the box, so the slats rest tightly on both of them

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1962" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/outdoor-furniture-5-attach-side-slats.jpg" alt="" width="606" height="582" />

<strong>Attach the side slats with the chair upside down. Start in the middle, and leave a 1-1/2 in. space between each slat.</strong>

Before nailing on the side slats, clip about 1/8 in. off the ends of the 4d nails, using your side cutter. This keeps the ends of the nails from protruding through the inside of the box — where they’d scratch your fanny but good! <strong>Be sure to wear eye protection while cutting off the tips.</strong> I cut the nails into a paper bag to keep the tips from flying around and ending up in my tire or shoe.

Glue and nail the side slats into the box and under arm cleats (T), starting with the center slat positioned in the middle of the box. Then move out in each direction, leaving a 1-1/2 in. space between each slat. To finish up, measure the distance between the front and back leg and cut piece S to fit snugly into place. Center S over the slats and nail through the bottom of S into each slat. To finish, nail into S from the front and back legs with two 6d galvanized finish nails.
<h3>Seat And Back Slats</h3>
All that's left is to attach the seat slats and back slats.

Start by centering seat slat N inside the box. Drill and screw it in place using two screws on each end. Then set the remaining slats, L and M, in position, leaving a 7/16-in. space between the slats. Screw them down.

Now you’re on the home stretch. Center Q on top of the center seat slat N and use a square (see below) to mark the correct vertical position so that all of the slats will be perfectly upright. Screw Q into place. Repeat the process for the remaining back slats.

Lastly, install the upper back brace K. Glue and screw K into the back slats using one screw in each narrow slat and two into the middle slat. Be sure to use 1-1/4 in. screws.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1963" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/outdoor-furniture-6-add-seat-and-back-slats.jpg" alt="" width="609" height="581" />

<strong>Add back and seat slats, starting in the middle and working out. Keep the back slats square to the frame.</strong>
<h3>Finishing</h3>
At this stage, you probably can’t wait to start using the chair. Go ahead – it’s a good way to reward yourself and put off the tedium of sanding.

However, don’t put off sanding and finishing too long. I made that mistake once, and the sun dried out the wood and left cracks at the ends of the boards. If you don’t have time to finish your furniture right away, store it in a shaded area.

To smooth the wood before finishing, use a sanding block and 100-grit paper. Then retrace your steps with 150-grit. If you have an electric finish sander, put it to work and you’ll get done in half the time.

Be particularly careful to remove saw marks from the edges of boards. Sand all the edges just enough to make them comfortable and to keep them from splintering.

To protect your labor of love, use one of the many wood sealers that protect decks and outdoor furniture from water and sun damage. Look for one that offers ultraviolet (UV) Protection.

You may want to match a particular wood tone that you already have on your house or deck. I used a mixture of a UV-blocking exterior deck sealer and boiled linseed oil in equal amounts. The sealer protects the wood and the linseed oil gives it a warm, natural glow.

You can also choose to let your chairs weather naturally. The advantage of doing this is that you avoid having to put a finish on at regular intervals, and you may prefer the gray, weathered look.

The disadvantages are that without a sealer, even a rot-resistant wood like cedar will crack and split from abrupt moisture changes, and the weathering may be uneven, so the chairs become mottled gray, brown, and black.

After finishing, wait at least 24 hours before relaxing in your chair. Put on another coat of finish after the first season of use, and as needed after that.
<h2>Outdoor Love Seat</h2>
The love seat is designed to seat two people comfortably, with enough room to cross your legs and talk to each other without feeling crowded.
<h3>Cutting List</h3>
[table id=39 /]
<h3>Shopping List</h3>
[table id=40 /]

To build the love seat, follow exactly the same building steps as the chair:
<ol>
 	<li>Build a box,</li>
 	<li>Attach the legs,</li>
 	<li>Then, the arms and sides,</li>
 	<li>Finally, the seat and back.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1965" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/outdoor-furniture-fig-b-love-seat.jpg" alt="" width="714" height="913" />

As you can see above, the only difference between the chair and the love seat is in the length of some of the parts, and the number of seat and back slats.
<h2>Outdoor Table</h2>
The table is great for serving snacks and beverages, and the lower shelf is a convenient place for books and magazines.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1966" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/outdoor-furniture-fig-c-table.jpg" alt="" width="718" height="847" />
<h3>Cutting List</h3>
[table id=41 /]
<h3>Shopping List</h3>
[table id=42 /]

The building method for the table is very similar to what you used for the chair, as shown below:
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Build two boxes from parts A and B,</li>
 	<li>then attach the legs just as you did with the Chair,</li>
 	<li>last, all that's left is to nail on the shelf slats and screw on the top slats.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Summer is here and it’s hot. It’s the kind of heat that makes tomato plants droop, barefoot kids hip-hop across paved sidewalks, and your ice cream cone drip before you can give it a lick.

It’s hard to imagine that not many generations ago, before air conditioning, shading was the best defense against summertime heat.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/shaded-front-porch.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="750" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1976" />

In those days our parents and grandparents worked inside if they could, near open windows. After work, they headed for the nearest covered porch, where they sat and fanned themselves, waiting for a cool breeze or simply sweating it out. Indoors, electric fans worked overtime.

And once commercial air conditioning arrived in town, they escaped to the air-conditioned theater for the afternoon matinee or shopped in an air-conditioned department store on weekends.

Today, years later, shading has taken a back seat to air conditioning, which has become a standard fixture in homes, in our workplaces and in our cars.

But don’t dismiss shading strategies as outdated. While porches are no longer so common, good shading at home is still important for energy conservation and comfort. It will reduce the time you run your air conditioner, thereby cutting your monthly electric bill by as much as a third.

And shade will make your yard cooler and more pleasant too.

In this article, I'll describe the ways shading can help your house escape the sun's heat. I'll also mention other cooling strategies like insulation and ventilation, which most homes, but not all, already have in place.

To begin, let’s follow the sun through a typical summer day and describe how it heats your house, and then describe the shading strategies you can use to block it.

<h2>Following The Sun’s Path</h2>

<h3>Morning</h3>

As every gardener, construction worker, and farmer knows, sunrise is the coolest time of the day and the best time to get the heavy work done. All night long, while the summer sun bakes folks on the other side of the globe, air temperatures drop around your home. At sunrise, the process reverses and the air begins to heat up again.

While the morning sun usually won't affect you, it does affect your house. The massive walls, ceilings, and floors slowly, but steadily, absorb heat on the outside and radiate it to the inside. Morning sunlight that directly strikes the east wall of your house begins the day-long warming process.

Unfortunately, houses don’t sweat, so once this heating begins, there's almost no way to reverse the process until sundown, except by turning on an air conditioner.

Fortunately, most homes now have at least one good defense. The same insulation that keeps your home warm in winter keeps it cool in the summer too, trapping most heat in the exterior part of a wall so it’s slow to reach the inside surface.

However, even a well-insulated house has key weak spots — the windows. Morning sunlight that pours through the eastern windows rapidly accelerates the heat buildup inside. To keep cool, it’s critical that you shade these windows.

I'll discuss shading methods later.

<h3>Noon</h3>

By noontime, the sun’s rays are hottest, because they're most intense, beating down from directly overhead. However, unlike what happens in the morning, the walls and windows of your house absorb much less heat during this period, because the sun hits them at such a sharp angle during summer months (Fig. C).

Actually, the noontime sun perches slightly to the south side of your house. Good architectural design should provide roof overhangs or porches to shade the walls during the middle of the day. Window shading on the south side can help too.

Your roof and attic catch the brunt of the noontime heat. Roof temperatures can soar beyond 160°F/70°C (egg-frying temperatures!). And attics become ovens.

Fortunately, most homes have a thick blanket of insulation in their attics, usually twice as much as in walls. Good attic ventilation helps too, but insulation is the main defense.

Before the widespread use of ceiling insulation, hot weather sometimes forced entire families to cook, eat and sleep on the covered back porch, so they could escape the stifling heat indoors. 

<h3>Afternoon</h3>

The sun continues to heat your house all afternoon, especially as it swings over to the west. In most regions, your air conditioner switches on by this time to counteract the heat buildup from morning and noon.

The outside air temperature usually peaks around 4 PM, then begins to drop.

<h3>Evening</h3>

In most regions, the day feels hottest around 6 PM. By now, the air temperature has dropped slightly, but rising humidity in the early evening creates a more intense sensation of heat.

So the evening sun can feel especially hot. If your kids are going to grumble, they'll probably do it at this time, and you can bet that evening shade will feel especially welcome.

The evening sun heats your home just like the morning sun, except that it strikes the west wall instead of the east wall. And the temperature inside your house will continue to rise even after sunset since the heat already in the exterior walls slowly works its way inside, where it radiates off the walls.

The evening is the hottest time of day inside. That's why it's more pleasant to relax outdoors or on a screened porch in the evening and into nightfall, rather than sweating it out inside.

After sunset, your house slowly cools down until morning, when the process begins again.

<h2>Window-Shading Devices</h2>

The path of the sun dictates the best placement for shading devices. Fig. A shows a variety of ways to shade windows, especially those east- and west-facing windows that catch direct sunlight.

Blinds and curtains are perhaps the most popular because they also provide privacy. The outer-facing side should be light-colored so it reflects sunlight and heat away from the window. Dark-colored shades are somewhat self-defeating because they absorb heat and draw it inside.

Outside blinds work better than inside blinds because they block the heat before it gets into the house. But few people use them because it's so inconvenient to run outside every time you want to raise and lower them.

Unfortunately, blinds, curtains, and shades block your view and cooling breezes if you want to keep your windows open.

One shading product particularly popular in the South is a densely woven insect screening, sometimes called shade cloth. This screening, made from fiberglass or aluminum, blocks up to 75 percent of sunlight.

Another option is a plastic film in various densities that you apply to your window glass to reflect or filter out some of the heat. These films are particularly useful if you want to prevent rugs and furniture fabric from fading under intense sunlight. Don't apply these films to double-pane windows, however, because they can cause a temperature imbalance that cracks the glass.

If you have to replace your windows anyway, buy double-pane glass with tinted or "low-e" coatings, which also block some of the sun's heat.

All of these shading methods (except buying new windows) are relatively inexpensive and can do a good job. You can install most of them yourself, using materials from well-stocked home centers.

Awnings are a good alternative if you want to catch cooling breezes because they shade without blocking the wind and only partially block the view. They're semi-permanent, you don't have to open and close them, and you can leave them up until cooler weather arrives in the fall.

If you have a good sewing machine, you can even make them yourself from canvas or reinforced nylon and inexpensive hardware parts you can buy from an awning dealer.

Awnings should extend about halfway down the window and have fabric sides to block the sun at all but extremely low angles.

No matter which ideas you use, remember to shade your east-facing windows to block the morning sun, and your west-facing windows to block the evening sun. Shading can be effective over south-facing windows too.

In all regions except Florida and the extreme southern United States, you should remove the shading devices in winter to allow maximum heat gain from the sun in cold weather.

<strong>Awnings, interior and exterior shades, shade screens, dark films, and tinted glass help shade windows and keep the sun's heat outside. Other shading features, like roof overhangs, covered porches, arbors, trellises and trees, shade both the roof and walls of your house as well as the windows.</strong>

<h2>Shading with Landscaping</h2>

Landscape shading blocks the sun before it hits your house in the first place. So it's a great strategy, assuming you can alter the area around your house.

Of course, landscaping makes your yard cooler and more attractive too. The general idea is to place trees and other foliage in such a way as to shade the house in summer, yet not in the winter.

In Figs. A and B you can see low foliage on the east and west sides to block the early morning and late evening sun. Moderate sized trees block late morning and early evening sun, and tall trees placed fairly close to the house cast shade over the roof during midday hours.

These are all broadleaf deciduous trees, which conveniently lose their leaves in winter, allowing more sunlight to hit the house when you welcome its heat.

In stormy areas with frequent high winds, you might not want to plant trees close to your house. Ask experts at your local nursery for their advice on which trees to plant and where to plant them.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/shade-your-house-from-the-sun-fig-b-foliage.jpg" alt="" width="771" height="575" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1971" />

<strong>In general, plant trees to shade the east- and west-facing walls of your home. Leave the south side open to receive the sun's warmth in winter. In regions with cold winters, plant dense evergreens on the north side to block the wind.</strong>

However, even the branches of leafless trees can block 30 to 40 percent of the sunlight. Because the winter sun hangs so low in the southern sky (Fig. C), the south-facing windows are by far the most important to keep as unobstructed as possible for winter heating.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/shade-your-house-from-the-sun-fig-c-paths-of-the-sun.jpg" alt="" width="761" height="572" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1972" />

<strong>Plan landscape shading to block the summer sun, but not the winter sun, which follows a lower arc in the winter sky.</strong>

Obviously, to develop the ideal shading pattern by landscaping is a long-term proposition. After all:

<ul><li>trees don't grow to the right height over-night;</li>
<li>the longest side of your house might not face south (which is ideal);</li>
<li>a neighbor's house could block your southern exposure; and</li>
<li>you won't want to cut down a beautiful tree because it's in the wrong place.</li></ul>

So use Figs. A and B as models and choose ideas you can apply to your own situation.

<h2>Landscaping by Region</h2>

Of course, the best shading strategy must take account of your local climate. The best shading trees and plants vary too, so rely on your local nursery to help you choose.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/shade-your-house-from-the-sun-fig-d-climatic-zones.jpg" alt="" width="778" height="634" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1973" />

<strong>Fig. D illustrates four zones, all of which have somewhat different cooling requirements. The climate in these zones can vary, so plan shading strategy according to local conditions. Hawaii's climate is moderate year-round.</strong>

<h3>Zone 1: Warm Summers & Cold Winters</h3>

In Zone 1, summer cooling isn't nearly as important, or expensive, as winter healing.

So a good landscaping plan would position trees and evergreens on the northwest side, the direction of cold north winds in Zone 1 while keeping the south side completely clear to gain as much heat as possible in winter.

For example, in Zone 1 you'd want to modify Figs. A and B by moving the large shade trees away from the south side of the house and by shifting the arbor at least 30 ft. from the south wall so it won't block the winter sun.

And you could add more evergreens on the north side to block more wind.

<h3>Zone 2: Hot Summers, Cold Winters, And (Sometimes) High Humidity</h3>

Without modifications, the landscape plan in Fig. A works best in Zone 2.

This zone is a region of hot and cold extremes, so the cooling shade of the arbor against the house makes sense.

The arbor also shades the patio, which would otherwise reflect sunlight and heat into the house.

Closely spaced trees and shrubs on the north side still block the cold north wind, but the foliage on the other three sides should be open enough to channel cooling summer breezes around the house.

<h3>Zone 2: Hot Summers, Mild Winters, And High Humidity</h3>

The principles in Zone 2 also apply to Zone 3 except that you don't have to worry about the cold north wind.

Shade trees with high canopies (leaves and branches) work best here because they allow the breezes to circulate easily beneath them.

High humidity in this zone becomes a critical factor because it makes summer days feel even hotter.

Since dense foliage produces a lot of humidity, you'll want to move vines and arbors away from the house and rely more on awnings, porches, roof overhangs, and other architectural devices for window shading.

<h3>Zone 4: Clear, Hot, And Dry Summers And Mild Winters</h3>

In Zone 4, the hot/arid region, you can move the shading vines, arbors and other foliage right back against the house, because the extra moisture these plants produce helps cool the air in this dry region.

Your plant choice will be more limited in this climate, so you might have to rely on awnings, window shades, porches and other features of your house to shade the east and west walls and windows. 

<h2>Final Thoughts: The Payoff</h2>

As you can see, no one shading device or landscaping idea is best for every home. But basic shading principles will help you choose what fits your home's style, your local climate (sometimes different from the regional climate), and certainly your budget.

The payoff will be a better looking, more comfortable, and more energy-efficient home.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>How Do I Repair My Wood Fence?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Take the wiggles, wobbles, and sags out of that old wood fence.

Whether it's for keeping Snoopy in or the snoopy neighbor out, a fence just can’t do its job — or look respectable — unless it’s in good repair.

Fences take a lot of abuse. The pickets and framework warp in the rain; posts below ground rot; the structure gets wracked by winds; gates get swung on, kicked and banged into.
<h2>Is It Worth Fixing My Old Wood Fence?</h2>
Before you tackle any single repair, inspect the entire fence.

If one post has a severe lean to it, give the others a firm shake to see if they're wobbly too. If one picket is rotten, probe others with a screwdriver to see if they're spongy too. If most of the framework feels solid, go ahead and perform the repairs and maintenance I show.

But if the framework is falling apart or half the posts are rotten, consider <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/build-wood-fence/">building a new fence</a>.
<h2>How Do I Fix A Sagging Wood Gate?</h2>
A gate can bind or drag because of loose hinge screws, an out-of-square opening, or the gate itself loosening and sagging.

Over time, a swinging gate can pull the post it’s hinged to away from the fence framework. If it does, push the vertical post back in position, then use “L” brackets and screws to reconnect this hinge post to the horizontal 2x4s as shown.

(Hint: Sometimes it’s necessary to cut 1/2 in. to 1 in. off the horizontal members beforehand, so you can push the post over more.)

If the gate still won’t fit the opening, remove it, trim an inch off one side with a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-circular-saw/">circular saw</a>, then rehang it.

Gates themselves can sag too.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1980" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/fence-repairs-1-sagging-gate.jpg" alt="" width="928" height="660" />

First, tighten all the hinge screws and use longer screws to replace those that no longer grip.

Next, use blocks of wood to raise the latch side of the gate until it sits squarely in the opening and the latch halves meet evenly.

Install a turnbuckle diagonally as shown above. Turnbuckles ($8 to $15) can be found at most home centers with the screen door hardware.

Secure the turnbuckle to the gate with lag screws while it’s in its longest position, so you can shorten it and pull the gate back into square. Use a pry bar (or wrench, depending on the type of turnbuckle) to rotate and tighten the turnbuckle.

Resecure loose gate pickets to cross members with galvanized screws after you tighten the turnbuckle.
<h2>How Do I Replace A Wood Fence Post?</h2>
<a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/straight-square-plumb-and-level/">Vertical</a> posts are the foundation of any fence; if they break, rot or loosen, the entire fence is on shaky legs.

A wobbly post doesn't necessarily need to be replaced, only firmed up. A post set directly into dirt can be firmed up by digging an 18-in. deep circle around it, then filling the circle with concrete.

Wobbly posts set in only a thin collar of concrete can be solidified by pounding the old concrete into the ground with a sledgehammer, then pouring new concrete, at least 6 in. deep, over it. Driving cedar shingles around the base of a post, as shown in Fig. 5, is a quick tune-up for minor wiggles.

Entire fences that have loose or rotting posts, but are in otherwise good shape, can be salvaged by installing new posts midway between the existing ones. This is a major project and can look tacky unless the new posts are kept to the back side of the fence or are somehow blended to look like part of the original design.

<strong>You can replace one or two damaged posts as shown:</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1981" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/fence-repairs-2-replace-post-pull-nails.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="585" />

<strong>1. Pull the nails that secure the fence sections to the vertical post on each side. Swing the sections 2 ft. out of the way, propping their free ends up on scrap boards.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1982" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/fence-repairs-3-pry-old-post.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="753" />

<strong>2. Pry the old post out of the ground. Those embedded in concrete can weigh 100 lbs. or more, making this a two-person job. Pull the post at an angle as you withdraw it, so it doesn’t slip back into the hole.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1983" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/fence-repairs-4-set-new-post.jpg" alt="" width="406" height="728" />

<strong>3. Set the new post in the hole, then level and nail the two fence sections back to it. Pack 4 or 5 in. of dirt around the base of the post to hold it plumb, then pour in the concrete. Bring the concrete above ground level and trowel the top so water runs away from the post.</strong>
<h2>How Do I Straighten, Tighten, And Maintain A Wood Fence?</h2>
Sometimes a fence just needs some TLC to make it look better and last longer. A well-built fence, installed in good draining soil and properly maintained, can last 25 years or longer.

Get rid of any leaf piles, sticks and debris stacked against the fence; they hold moisture that promotes rot and can harbor termites and other critters harmful to wood fences.

<a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/mulching/">Installing gravel</a> or a row of patio block below the fence eliminates both the hassle of trimming grass in this awkward area and the damage that weed trimmers and mowers inflict on a fence. Dig a shallow trench and line it with black plastic before installing the rock or block.

Install intermediate support blocks, shim loose posts and add cap blocks, as shown, to improve the look and durability of a fence. Resecure any loose pickets or cross members with galvanized drywall screws.

<a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/wood-finishing-pigmented-stain/">Stain</a> or <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/house-paint-types/">paint your fence</a> after all repairs are made. It will help blend old and new wood parts and add an extra coat of protection against the elements.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1984" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/fence-repairs-5-maintenance-1024x729.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="397" />

<strong>Install support blocks to raise sagging sections. Use a small jack to straighten each section, then measure, cut and install a short length of 4x4 set in a patio block for support.</strong>

<strong>Add cap blocks to vertical posts. The exposed and grain of posts can absorb water, contributing to rot and cracking. Cutting the tops to a pyramid shape will also help shed water.</strong>

<strong>Shim loose posts by driving cedar shingles around their base. Cut off protruding portions with a utility knife, then seal the top with silicone caulk.</strong>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>How to Install a Pedestal Sink - w/ Detailed Pictures</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Make a small bathroom look bigger, or a big bathroom look better!

Go into any bathroom in today’s model homes. especially the half-bath or powder room (sink and toilet, no tub or shower), and you're likely to find a pedestal sink. And for good reason.

Pedestal sinks are elegant, without being overstated. They also make the room look bigger because of the exposed floor and wall space that’s normally covered by a vanity.

You do lose the storage space normally found inside the vanity, but you can get most of it back by installing a larger medicine cabinet, or a wall-mounted cabinet that’s designed to fit above the toilet (called an "over-john" cabinet).

<h2>How Should You Choose A Pedestal Sink?</h2>

Pedestal sinks are sold in just about every home center and at plumbing supply stores. Prices start at under $200 and can go well over $1,000. The designs are more attractive and the quality better as the price increases.

The difference in quality may be most noticeable in the appearance of the ceramic — cheaper models often have flaws and imperfections. And while surface flaws don’t affect the sink's function, they're quite obvious and may signal a shorter life expectancy as well because the glaze that protects the surface is usually quite thin.

However, when a high-quality pedestal sink is installed, you won't be disappointed. All the work will have been worth it.

<h2>More Than Putting In A Sink</h2>

Make a quick comparison of Photos 1, 2, and and 3 and the opening photo. There’s usually a lot more to this project than just replacing an old, outdated vanity.

A pedestal sink installation is often part of a larger bathroom renovation, so this project is generally not for a rank beginner. Don’t plan to complete this project in a couple of days, either.

You'll need to make drywall repairs, since you'll probably be moving the water supply lines, which are inside the wall. The old flooring and wallcovering (paint or wallpaper) won‘t do much to complement the new sink, either, so you’ll probably want to redecorate.

In this article, I don't show you how to do the cosmetic repairs, but you may find what you are looking for in a related article I’ve already published:

<h2>Preliminary Checking</h2>

Installing a sink is installing a sink, right? Not when you’re dealing with a pedestal style.

All of the water connections (shutoff valves, traps, and drain) will be exposed, so you need to examine your current plumbing connections and their locations and compare them to the installation requirements of the new sink before you buy it.

This couple of articles might be helpful for you:

<ul><li><a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/plumbing-traps/">Types of plumbing traps and how they work</a></li>
<li><a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/plumbing/">7 basic plumbing fixes</a></li></ul>

To help you decide if you can or want to install a pedestal sink in your bathroom, you need to measure the height of the existing drain opening in the wall. That’s the spot where the metal or plastic drain waste arm goes into the wall (Photo 2).

Measure from the floor to the center of the drain opening and compare that measurement to the drain height requirement of the new sink. If the measurements are within an inch or so, you can probably install a pedestal sink, If you need to move the drain, which is unlikely, you may not want to go any further.

<h2>Tools For Two Changes</h2>

You'll need a variety of tools for both carpentry and plumbing repairs.

For the carpentry work you’ll need:

<ul><li>a utility knife,</li>
<li>a drywall saw,</li>
<li>a short length of 2x8 board (at least 16 in. long),</li>
<li>some 2-1/2 or 3-in. drywall screws,</li>
<li>an <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-drill-driver-kit/">electric drill</a>, and</li>
<li>a stud finder.</li></ul>

For the plumbing changes, round up the following:
<ul><li>one 10-ft. length of 1/2-in. rigid copper pipe (used to make the new supply lines),</li>
<li>an assortment of l/2-in., 90—degree elbows and unions,</li>
<li>a dielectric union (if your existing water supply lines are galvanized),</li>
<li>a tube cutter (the smaller “mini” size is better for working in cramped quarters),</li>
<li>a hacksaw,</li>
<li>lead-free solder,</li>
<li>emery cloth,</li>
<li>plumber's paste (flux), and</li>
<li>a propane torch for soldering.</li>
</ul>

You'll also need:

<ul><li>two compression shutoff valves (these are secured to the new water supply pipes with a brass compression ring and a nut -- no soldering!),</li>
<li>a new drain trap assembly, and</li>
<li>new water supply tubes.</li></ul>

Keep some rags and a bucket handy too.

<h2>Removing The Old Stuff</h2>

The first thing you need to do is shut off the water to the bathroom sink. Disconnect the water supply lines, drain arm, and trap. Then remove the old vanity and sink (Photo 1). It's probably screwed to the wall and may require some additional effort to break it free from the floor too.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pedestal-sink-1-shut-off-water.png" alt="" width="657" height="517" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1990" />

<strong>Shut off the water at the water main (near the meter), then disconnect the water supply tubes and the drain. Remove the old vanity, sink and faucet.</strong>

Whether your old sink had shutoff valves underneath it or it looks like ours (sweat-soldered fittings on the water supply lines that come out of the wall; see Photo 2), you’ll want to replace them. To do this. you’ll have to shut off the water at the water meter.

The meter is usually located in the basement or crawl space. If your home is on a slab (no basement or crawl space), it's usually where the main water line enters the house, which is often in the garage or laundry room. The entire house will be without water, so make sure everyone knows this in advance.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pedestal-sink-2-cut-off-old-elbows.png" alt="" width="517" height="602" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1991" />

<strong>Cut off the old elbows with a tube cutter and then remove the escutcheon plate. Keep some rags and a bucket handy -- you’ll need them. Remove the wallboard to gain access to the water supply lines.</strong>

Photo 2 shows the old water supply elbows and the drain waste arm. The new shutoff locations (the required height measurement, 24 in. for this sink, was in the sink's instructions) are indicated with an “X.” They're closer together than the old ones. The new valves will be 4 in. apart; the old elbows were about 10 in. apart. The new ones also are level with each other.

These shutoff valves are going to be 4 in. apart so we can hide them behind the pedestal. Doing this is harder because the work space is confined, but the final look (see Photo 8) is worth it.

Another option is to make the valves level, but space them 8 in. apart. The shutoff valves and supply tubes will show, but that's okay. New chrome valves and chrome supply tubes look just fine.

<h2>Getting Inside The Wall</h2>

Before you can remove the drywall to begin the plumbing changes, you need to cut off the old elbows with a tube cutter (Photo 2). I used a mini-tube cutter because I'll be cutting off the existing copper supply lines in the wall. and a regular tube cutter is too big. Remove the escutcheon plate once the elbows have been cut off

When you cut out the drywall, do the following to make the repair work easier and look better. Use a utility knife to cut the drywall back slightly wider than the wall stud cavity to expose a 1/2-in. to 3/4-in. lip of 2x4 (Photo 3). Use this lip to secure the new drywall patch.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pedestal-sink-3-cut-off-water-supply-pipes.png" alt="" width="519" height="607" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1992" />

<strong>Cut off the water supply pipes, then solder on new pipes to make the new shutoff valves level. Install the backer board, used to hold the sink’s hanger bracket. Close up the wall and make the cosmetic repairs.</strong>

Cut off the existing vertical water supply lines with the tube cutter so they’re level (Photo 3). This allows you to add the same length pipes to both the existing hot and cold supply pipes so the new shutoff valves are level and evenly spaced.

Fig. A shows both the new copper supply lines and stubouts (4 in. apart, level and shown in orange), and the old elbows, shown in pink.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pedestal-sink-fig-a-new-copper-supply-pipes.png" alt="" width="566" height="734" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1999" />

<strong>FIG. A -- New Copper Supply Pipes</strong>

When you make the water supply line changes, use the fewest number of elbows possible, We used two 90-degree elbows and three lengths of pipe to make each new supply line and stubout.

The exact length of pipe depends on the existing pipe, so you’ll have to measure. The shorter pieces move the supply pipes 4 in. apart and form the stubout from the wall. The longer piece is used to bring the water supply stubouts to the correct height. Check your instructions for shutoff heights.

Then solder a cap over the end of each stubout so you can turn the water back on for the rest of the house.

<h3>Soldering Copper Pipes</h3>

All of the copper connections are sweat-soldered. For leak-free connections, the ends of the pipe and the inside of all the fittings must be clean and corrosion-free.

The best way to clean these pipes is with emery cloth. Apply plumber's paste (flux) to the cleaned pipe area before assembling the pipe and fittings.

Heat the fitting (not the pipe) with the flame from the propane torch and touch the solder to the joint. The hot fitting will draw the solder into the joint and seal it.

As the fitting starts to cool (remove the torch flame from the fitting for a couple of seconds), run a bead of solder around the joint. The fitting will still be hot enough to melt the solder.

<h3>Dealing With Galvanized Pipes</h3>

If your water supply pipes are galvanized, you can still make the changes with copper pipe. Just be sure to install a dielectric union between the galvanized and copper pipes.

A dielectric union has a plastic spacer that prevents corrosion and later leakage. The galvanized pipe end of the union is threaded; the copper pipe end is soldered onto the copper supply pipe. Dielectric unions are available at any plumbing supply store.

<h3>Installing A Backer Board</h3>

Once the water supply pipe heights are correct, you should install the backer board (Photo 3). It's required by most sink manufacturers to secure the hanger bracket that holds the sink.

The backer board should be a length of 2x8 that fits between the wall studs. The backer is secured with four drywall screws into the wall studs The installation height for the hacker will be in the sink instructions.

If the 2x8 board is too thick, especially if the wall studs are 2x4s or the drain vent pipe is in the way. use a 1x8 board. You can notch the front edge of the wall studs with a handsaw and set the 1x8 into the notches. Then secure it to the 2x4 with drywall screws.

<h2>Installing New Shutoffs</h2>

Before moving to the next step, notice that there’s now quite a difference in the appearance of our bathroom. All of the repairs to the drywall were made, plus painted, wallpapered, installed chair rail molding and put in a new bathroom floor.

You should make your cosmetic repairs at this time too, so you don’t have to work around the new sink.

To begin the installation, shut off the water to the bathroom once again so you can cut off the caps on the stubouts and install the shutoff valves.

Measure out from the wall 1-3/8 in., make a mark on the stubout and cut it off with the tube cutter (Photo 4). Keep the rags and bucket handy to catch the water that will spill from the pipe. A 1-3/8 in. pipe stubout from the surface of the wall is the correct length to fit the shutoff valve and still be completely covered by the valve's escutcheon plate.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pedestal-sink-4-install-compression-shutoff-valves.png" alt="" width="513" height="524" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1993" />

<strong>Install the compression shutoff valves. Cut off the stubout, leaving 1-3/8 in. protruding from the wall. This length works best for installing the new valve. The rest of the stub is covered by the escutcheon plate.</strong>

Now install the compression-fit shutoff valve. Most compression valve packages have adequate instructions printed on them. However, let's walk you through the steps (Photo 4 shows one shutoff valve already installed):

<ol><li>Slip the compression nut over the pipe and then slip the brass compression ring over the pipe. The nut threads must face the cut end of the pipe.</li>
<li>Slide the valve as far onto the pipe as it will go. Now screw the compression nut onto the fitting. The nut is tightened onto the fitting and snugs the brass compression ring onto the copper supply pipe to form a leak-free joint.</li></ol>

Make sure the shutoff valves are closed (turned clockwise until tight). Now, have someone else turn the water back on for the rest of the house so you can check the valves for leaks.

Secure the hanger bracket to the wall (Photo 5). The bracket is usually secured with 1/4-in. dia. lag bolts screwed into the backer board. The brackets also have slots so you can make small height adjustments (about 1 in.) to level the sink.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pedestal-sink-5-position-hanger-bracket.png" alt="" width="509" height="530" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1994" />

<strong>Position the hanger bracket on the wall and secure it into the backer board with 1/4-in. dia. log bolts. Use a level to make sure the hanger bracket is level. The slots allow for leveling adjustments.</strong>

<h2>Sink And Faucet Assembly</h2>

Begin by attaching the new faucet to the sink. The way it's secured to the sink depends on the brand of faucet

This faucet has separate handles and spout, so there are a couple of additional water supply tube connections. The hot water and cold water supply tubes are connected to a mixing valve (Photo 6).

Consult your faucet’s instructions and the drain and trap instructions, since the installation steps vary widely among brands.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pedestal-sink-6a-attach-faucet-and-drain.png" alt="" width="514" height="601" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1995" />

<strong>Attach the faucet and drain to the sink. Check both the sink and faucet instructions for specific directions, since faucet assembly varies widely. Be careful when you bond attached copper supply tubes on the faucet. If you kink or split them, you’ll have to buy another faucet.</strong>

Notice that our faucet handles are 8 in. apart but we positioned the shutoff valves 4 in. apart to hide the valves and supply tubes behind the pedestal. (I like the look of the 8-in. faucet better than the 4-in. style.)

These faucet handle stems also have copper supply tubes attached, so we had to bend these tubes to approximately 4 in. apart before attaching the supply tube.

If your faucet has attached copper supply tubes, be careful when you bend them. It's easy to put a kink or flat spot in the tube But if you bend them slowly and gently, using two hands, you’ll be able to get them into the correct position.

Work carefully! If you kink or split the tubes, you'll have to buy another faucet -- you won’t be able to fix it.

The type of supply tube to use between the faucet and shutoff valve depends on how much bending is required to get tubes to the shutoff valves.

Chrome supply tubes are available in smooth or corrugated (flexible). If you’re really cramped for space, you could use a braided metal supply tube. All three types come in different lengths and meet the current plumbing codes (inset to Photo 6).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pedestal-sink-6b-water-supply-tubes.png" alt="" width="425" height="564" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1996" />

<strong>Water supply tubes some in a variety of styles. The smooth or corrugated chrome tubes allow for gradual bends and can be cut to length. The braided metal tube can’t be cut, but it can handle more severe twists and turns. All three meet current plumbing codes.</strong>

The chrome supply tubes can be cut to length with a tube cutter. The braided metal type can’t be cut, but it's much more flexible. You’ll have to make sure that the connecting joints for the drain tailpiece.

P-trap and waste arm line up with one another, both vertically and horizontally when the sink is on the wall. This means you’ll probably have to cut off the tailpiece (Photo 6) with a hacksaw to the correct length. Don’t cut the tailpiece until you test-fit the drain and trap with the sink in place. Then cut it to the exact length.

<h2>Hanging The Sink</h2>

Now’s when you’ll appreciate a helper. Pedestal sinks are heavy and hard to handle. It’s much easier to position the sink on the hanger bracket and then line up all of the plumbing connections with two people working together. However, it can be done by one person.

Once the sink is securely on the hanger bracket. you can connect the P-trap to the drain waste arm in the wall and the supply tubes into the shutoff valves (Photo 7).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pedestal-sink-7-hang-sink-on-hanger-bracket.png" alt="" width="505" height="636" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1997" />

<strong>Hang the sink on the hanger bracket. Then attach the water supply tubes to the compression shutoff valves and the drain F-trap to the drain waste arm.</strong>

The drain and trap sections are secured with slip nuts and slip washers. The supply tubes are secured into the shutoff valves by a compression fitting.

Position the pedestal by lifting the bowl slightly and pushing the pedestal under the bowl (Photo 8).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pedestal-sink-8-position-pedestal-under-sink.png" alt="" width="514" height="640" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1998" />

<strong>Position the pedestal under the sink. Put thin cardboard under the pedestal to protect the floor when you slide the pedestal. Lift up slightly on the sink as you slide the pedestal.</strong>

Don't lift up on the bowl too much when positioning the pedestal (only about 1/8 in. and no more than 1/4 in.). You could crack the sink at the hanger or cause the sink to slip off the hanger bracket completely.

Place a thin piece of cardboard under the pedestal to prevent it from scratching the floor when you slide it. You can remove the cardboard once the pedestal is in place.

Most sinks and pedestals are secured to the wall and floor, respectively, with lag bolts. Fig. B shows where the sink and pedestal are secured. Check your sink instructions for their recommended location, installation method, and the size of the anchoring bolt needed to secure the sink.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pedestal-sink-fig-b-securing-bowl-and-pedestal.png" alt="" width="556" height="780" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2000" />

<strong>Fig. B Securing the bowl and pedestal.</strong>

You’ll probably need to drill a starter hole for the pedestal’s bolt, since you’ll be cramped for space and the starter hole will make this step easier. Mark the floor through the hole in the base of the pedestal and then slide the pedestal out. Now drill the hole.

If you try to drill the starter hole through the hole in the base, you'll most likely chip or crack the pedestal.

After both are secured, apply a head of clear silicone caulk along the top edge of the bowl where it meets the wall. Also caulk where the pedestal touches the floor.

Finally, turn the water on at the shutoff valves and fill the sink bowl completely with water. Then let it out. This sudden rush of water is the best way to check the drain assembly and P-trap for leaks.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The number one pastime in America? It's not jogging, bowling or collecting Elvis memorabilia. It's puttering in our yards and gardens. And we putter with a vengeance. Flowers, grass, and vegetables over-take our yards. Tillers, trimmers and tomato stakes overrun our garages.

Sometimes half the battle is just finding and untangling things before we can get down to pleasure (or business, as the case might be).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/garden-shed-00-front-side.jpg" alt="" width="780" height="504" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2003" />

What you need is a shed big enough to hold all your stuff, sturdy enough to last for generations and quaint enough to be a place you'll want to spend all afternoon. That's the garden shed I'll show you how to build. 

<h2>What Makes This Garden Shed Unique?</h2>
 
Those slap-'em-up storage sheds displayed in home center parking lots across America are quickly built and affordable but are notoriously boxy, flimsy and small.

This shed, by comparison, is sturdy, attractive and unique from floor to root It includes:

<ul><li><strong>A post-supported wood floor</strong>. It allows you to build the shed on a slope, low area or the top of a hill.</li>
<li><strong>A metal roof</strong>. The old-fashioned corrugated roofing may have caught your eye first. But the underlying framework—the hand-built roof trusses and support purlins—are part of this unique building system too.</li>
<li><strong>A Dutch door</strong>. Part window, part door; this arched-top door is functional. But most people will build it simply because they love the quaint look.</li></ul>

This shed isn't for those who need quick storage in a weekend. It's for those willing to invest the time, money and energy to create a permanent, well-built structure. 

<h2>Altering This Garden Shed Design</h2>

This design features a 10x12-ft. shed with three windows and a 3-ft. wide door; you may have different needs or ideas.

You can change this design in the following ways:

<ul><li><strong>Shed size</strong>. You can lengthen the 10-ft. side of the shed as long as the perimeter beam is supported by additional posts (with a 6-ft. maximum spacing). However, increasing the width of the 12-ft. side requires changing the truss design.</li>
<li><strong>Door and window size</strong>. You can install wider windows and doors, but you must increase the header size (Photo 9). Your building inspector or a structural engineer should be consulted before you modify the plans.</li>
<li><strong>Metal roofing</strong>. Various colors and styles are available. The 18-in. purlin spacing (Photo 13) we used will support most types of metal roofing, but consult the roof-ing manufacturer before making changes. You can also use more, or longer, translucent roof panels (Photo 15) to bring in more light.</li></ul>

<h2>Material Matters: Plan Ahead</h2>

You need to track down or special order a few oddball items:

The metal corrugated roofing is stocked at some home centers and lumber-yards, but you may need to order it through a metal building supplier (search for metal building specialists, roofing materials stores, siding material distributors). This is also the time to order the special roof nails (Photo 14), ridge cap and foam strips (Photo 16).

The 6x6 posts that support the floor must be pressure treated to a .60 or "foundation grade" level. Common 6x6 landscape timbers (usually treated to .40) are less resistant to rot and insects. Buy your posts from a lumberyard or metal roofing supplier; if they specialize in farm building materials, they'll have access to them.

The floor framing and plywood, which is open to the ground below (but in this design, isn't in direct contact with the ground), should be pressure treated to .25 or "above ground" levels.

<h2>What Does It Take To Build This Garden Shed?</h2>

This isn't a project for the novice; you'll need to feel comfortable working with angles, power tools, heights and the trials of a long project.

On the other hand, you're not building a nuclear reactor. If you've built a deck or undertaken a large remodeling project, you can handle this one — no sweat.

<h2>How Long Will It Take To Build This Garden Shed?</h2>

<strong>Working mostly alone, you could easily spend a total of six weekends</strong>, splitting a weekend each on:

<ol><li>constructing the platform floor</li>
<li>cutting and building the trusses</li>
<li>building the walls</li>
<li>installing trusses and roofing</li>
<li>installing the siding</li>
<li>building the doors, windows and workbench. And painting.</li></ol>

<h2>How Much Will It Cost To Build A 10x12 Shed?</h2>

<strong>The total cost to build this garden shed varies between $2,400 and $ 2,900.</strong>

The material costs were the following:

<ul><li>$505 for the bagged concrete and pressure-treated posts, lumber and plywood used for the floor;</li>
<li>$600 for the 2x4s, 2x6s and plywood used to build the walls and roof system; </li>
<li>$280 for the metal roofing, ridge cap, skylight panels and nails;</li>
<li>windows were an irresistible $25 each, for a total of $75; and</li>
<li>hardware and paint added $240.</li></ul>

The total cost for the rough structure at about $1,700.

I also splurged and spent $1,200 for the clear cedar used for siding, fascia, doors, shutters and outside trim – you could get by for half that by using knotty cedar or pine.

For the exact cost of materials, bring the illustration of the shed (fig. A) and materials list to a full-service lumberyard where they'll make up a cost estimate for you.

<h2>What Tools Do I Need To Build This Garden Shed?</h2>

You'll need just basic tools:

<ul><li><a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-circular-saw/">circular saw</a></li>
<li><a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-drill-driver-kit/">drill</a></li>
<li>4-ft. level, and</li>
<a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/new-hobby-woodworking/">standard hand tools</a>.</li></ul>

Sturdy step and extension ladders, plus a set of metal roofing brackets are a must.

<h2>Do I Need A Permit Before Building A Shed In My Backyard?</h2>

Most communities have regulations on "outbuildings" such as this. Some have strict ordinances as to the size and style of sheds; you'll need to submit plans, purchase a building permit and have your project inspected as you proceed. Other areas won't require a permit at all unless the shed exceeds a certain number of square feet (often around 100).

Permit or not, almost every community has setback regulations governing how far from the property line the shed can be located.

Call your local building inspector to let him or her know what you're planning to build.

<a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/">Also ask your local utility companies to come out and mark underground electrical, telephone, gas or water lines</a>. This project requires digging, hitting one of these lines can be dangerous (and expensive)!

<h2>Ground Work</h2>

Use a garden hose to loosely outline the shape of your shed. Move it around until you find the best space in your yard, then remove the sod from the shed's footprint with a square-nose shovel.

Next, establish the corners of the shed. It's important to lay out an exact rectangle with square corners; everything from your floor plywood to the metal roof panels will give you fits if you cheat on this step.

The key is to use batter boards (Photo 1). Drive in a trio of 2x2 stakes about 1 ft. beyond each approximate shed corner. Connect these stakes with 2-ft. long 1x2s. Stretch a string between the batter boards to establish one shed side, then stretch a line exactly parallel to this 10 ft. away to indicate the opposite wall (the batter boards let you slide the string along the 1x2 to fine-tune the distances).

Use a carpenter's square to position a third-string roughly perpendicular to the first two. Set this third line exactly square by marking 3 ft. along this string and 4 ft. along the adjacent string from where the two intersect.

Measure diagonally between the two marks (Photo 1) and move the third string (the hypotenuse) until you get a measurement of exactly 5 ft. between the two marks; this will give you a precise, square corner. Finally, set your fourth string parallel to the third.

<strong>Check the shed's perimeter for squareness. Measure 3 ft. and 4 ft. along intersecting strings, then shift the strings along the batter boards until you arrive at a 5-ft. hypotenuse.</strong>

Dig 12-in. dia. holes where the strings cross at each corner and at halfway points between. The depth of the holes will vary according to frost depth (how deep the ground freezes in your area). Consult your building inspector on this.

Mix concrete, then place enough at the bottom of each hole to create 8-in. thick pads (I used two 60-lb. bags of concrete mix per hole). Cover the holes with ply-wood so kids, frogs and other critters don't fall in, then let the concrete harden overnight.

<strong>Shovel concrete into 12-in. dia. holes dug to frost depth. Add enough concrete to create an 8-in. thick pad. Let the concrete harden overnight.</strong>

<h2>Building The Floor</h2>

If you've built a deck, you'll be familiar with this procedure.

Place a 6x6 treated post in the hole located at the highest ground level. Mark the post 2 in. above ground level, remove it from the hole, cut it to length, then place it back in the hole. Position the post's outside corner exactly where the strings intersect, level it, then partially surround it with gravel.

Place an overly long post in another corner hole and use a level and straight 2x4 to mark it level with the top of the already installed post (Photo 3).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/garden-shed-03-mark-posts-cut.jpg" alt="" width="635" height="610" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2008" />

<strong>Mark the posts, then cut them at a uniform height. Set the post located at the highest corner of the site first, then use it as a reference to level from.</strong>

Withdraw this post, cut it to length, then reinstall it at the string intersection and partially fill the hole with gravel. Repeat this at all the corners.

Determine the height of the intermediate posts by placing overly long posts in the intermediate holes, stringing lines from corner post to corner post, then marking and cutting the posts level with the corner posts they're located between.

Cut and install the pressure-treated 2x8s that create the double beam perimeter (Fig A). 

<strong>Fig. A: Shed Overview</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/garden-shed-fig-a-shed-overview.jpg" alt="" width="984" height="952" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2028" />

Fasten the 2x8s to the 6x6 posts with 16d galvanized nails driven at an angle (toenailed). Mark the location of the 2x8 joists on the 12-ft. long perimeter beams, with the centers of the joists positioned every 16 in.

Nail each joist to its mark with a couple of 8d nails, then secure them to the beam with joist hangers (Photo 4). Use special joist hanger nails; ordinary or shingle nails aren't strong enough.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/garden-shed-04-build-framework-platform-floor.jpg" alt="" width="690" height="659" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2009" />

<strong>Build the framework for the platform floor. First, install the double 2x8 perimeter, then secure the treated joists every 16 in. using joist hangers.</strong>

Nail the 3/4-in, treated plywood flooring to the joists (Photo 5). Stagger the joints so the ends of the plywood don't end up on the same joist.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/garden-shed-05-install-staggered-plywood-floor.jpg" alt="" width="862" height="493" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2010" />

<strong>Install the 3/4-in. treated plywood floor using 8d galvanized nails. Stagger the ends on different joists for the greatest strength.</strong>

<h2>Building The Trusses</h2>

You may be thinking, "Wait a minute, we're leaving out a critical part here — the walls." You're right, but the smooth, flat platform you just finished provides the ideal place to build the roof trusses.

Cut the 2x6s, 2x4s, and 1/2-in. plywood needed to build one "test" roof truss (Fig. 13).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/garden-shed-fig-b-truss-detail.jpg" alt="" width="937" height="692" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2029" />

<strong>Fig. B: Truss Detail</strong>

Use a saw protractor or Speed square to mark the angles. Select straight boards for this since you'll be using these pieces as patterns; severely bowed ones will make joints and angles look like they don't fit when they really do.

Position the 2x6s into a triangular shape (with over-hanging tails), insert the shorter 2x4s and check the fit. <strong>If an angle or joint appears radically wrong, check the individual pieces again to make sure you haven't turned a 40-degree angle into a 50-degree angle or vice versa (a common mistake).</strong>

Once your test truss fits together, use the individual pieces as patterns to trace identical pieces for the other four trusses (Photo 6).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/garden-shed-06-precut-truss-components.jpg" alt="" width="632" height="612" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2011" />

<strong>Precut the truss components to length. First cut all the pieces for one truss and assemble it. Check it for accuracy, then use the individual pans as patterns.</strong>

Lay out the components for a truss on the floor, then use plywood gussets to secure the pieces to one another (Photo 7).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/garden-shed-07-assemble-trusses-using-floor-1024x530.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="288" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2012" />

<strong>Assemble the trusses using the floor as an assembly table. Glue and nail the plywood gusset plates on both sides where the 2x4s and 2x6s join. Set the completed trusses aside on a flat area.</strong>

Plywood gussets, with a large nailing surface, are a strong, convenient method of joining truss components (direct nailing would only splinter the ends of the boards and weaken the truss).

Use construction adhesive and 1-1/2 in. shingle nails to secure all six gussets on one side, then carefully flip the truss over and glue and nail the gussets to the other side on three trusses. (Leave off the gussets on one face of the two gable trusses so they don't interfere with the outer plywood sheathing.)

As you complete each truss, stack it on a flat surface off the platform.

<h2>All Right! Not The Walls</h2>

Cut to length and temporarily nail together four pairs of 2x4 nailing plates (Photo 8).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/garden-shed-08-mark-position-studs-doors-windows.jpg" alt="" width="633" height="612" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2013" />

<strong>Mark the position of the studs, doors, and windows on the double sets of nailing plates. Locate the 7-ft. studs every 16 in.</strong>

Two pairs are 12 ft. long and two pairs are 9 ft., 5 in. (10 ft. minus two 3-1/2 in. wide walls).

Mark the position of the windows and doors and use a square to transfer the marks onto both top and bottom nailing plates.

Mark the stud locations every 16 in.

Split apart one pair of nailing plates and "fill in the blanks" with studs, cripples, trimmers and headers (Photo 9).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/garden-shed-09-nail-walls-together.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="612" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2014" />

<strong>Nail the walls together. Install headers and trimmers at all door and window openings for support.</strong>

Secure each 7-ft. stud with two 16d nails at each end. Again, use the wood floor as a building stage, carrying each completed wall off to make room for the next.

When all four walls are built, stand them in place. Nail them to the platform with 16d nails, then to each other at the corners. With an assistant holding a 4-ft. level at the corner, nail diagonal cross braces to hold the walls vertical.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/garden-shed-10-secure-walls-to-one-another.jpg" alt="" width="692" height="668" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2015" />

<strong>Secure walls to one another. Nail corners together, then level and hold them vertical with cross braces. Add a second top plate for strength.</strong>

Install the overlapping top plates (Photo 11) to lock the wall tops to one another, then cut and install ply-wood sheathing to complete the rough wall framing.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/garden-shed-11-sheathe-walls.jpg" alt="" width="636" height="614" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2016" />

<strong>SHEATHE walls with 1/2-in. plywood (or wafer board). Overlap ply-wood onto 2x8 platform perimeter and nail to firmly anchor walls to floor.</strong>

<h2>Trusses And Purlins</h2>

This metal roof involves more than nailing down steel panels in place of asphalt shingles; it's an entire system.

The trusses are sturdier than ordinary rafters, but spaced farther apart; 2x4 purlins, rather than sheets of plywood, are used to support the metal; and the 2-ft. wide roofing panels are installed with special nails. It's a system often used for agricultural buildings and pole barns.

The completed building isn't as weathertight as "normal" buildings, and finishing the interior is difficult (but usually isn't done anyway), but it's a quick, economical way to build a sturdy structure.

Installing your prebuilt trusses is a two-person job—better yet, a three- or four-person job. First, make marks along the tops of the 10 ft. long walls at

<ul><li>2 ft., 6 in.;</li>
<li>5 ft.; and</li>
<li>7 ft., 6 in.,</li></ul>

so you know where to position the three intermediate trusses.

Lift the two end trusses into place and nail them even with the wall framing. Use a level to plumb them, then temporarily brace them to the floor with long 2x4s. Slide the intermediate trusses onto the walls (Photo 12).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/garden-shed-12-lift-trusses.jpg" alt="" width="689" height="669" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2017" />

<strong>Lift trusses in place and nail to wall tops. Set and brace both gable-end trusses first. Then position and nail inter-mediate trusses to the 2x4 ribbon.</strong>

Lift each peak and nail it to a 2x4 ribbon marked at the same intervals as the wall tops. Toenail the trusses to the walls, keeping the ends of the 12-ft. bottom board (chord) even with the outside of the wall framing.

Next "mass mark" all 12 purlins and five trusses. Mark the location of each purlin (Fig. A) on both end gables, then snap chalk lines so all the trusses have identical marks on them. Next, measuring from the end of one 2x4 purlin, mark the length of the front gable overhang, the position of the five trusses and the length of the back gable overhang.

Use this as a pattern for marking the other purlins. Nail the purlins to the trusses, using the layout marks on each as a guide. <strong>Take special care to position the second purlin from the bottom, so the siding can butt directly to the bottom of it.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/garden-shed-13-nail-purlins.jpg" alt="" width="689" height="670" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2018" />

<strong>Nail the purlins to the trusses with 16d nails, making sure the overhang remains consistent. Use installed purlins for a ladder as you work.</strong>

Finally, nail the 2x6 cedar fascia (Photo 14) across the free ends of the purlins.

<h2>Metal Roofing</h2>

First, determine the overall length of the roof panels. They should fall short of the peak by about an inch (the ridge cap will cover the gap) and run past the truss tails another inch (for protection).

Cut the metal roofing with a circular saw and special metal-cutting blade or with aviation snips. Lots of old-timers use a plain steel blade turned backward in a circular saw for cutting — but it's noisy, sparky and I don't recommend it.

Position the first panel so it overhangs the fascia by about 1/2 in. Secure the panel to the purlins by driving the special nails through every third "peak" in the corrugated roofing. Don't install nails in the very last peak, where the next piece will overlap it. Pound in each nail until the washer flattens out to seal around the nail-head (Photo 14).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/garden-shed-14-secure-metal-panels-to-purlins.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="959" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2019" />

<strong>Secure the metal panels to the purlins using special nails. Overlap sheets by one corrugation. The rubber washer flattens and seals around the nail hole.</strong>

Predrill the holes if you have trouble driving in the nails without crushing the metal.

This can be a problem, especially near ends and edges. If you do distort the metal, wedge a small pry bar between the purlin and back side of the sheet to pop it back out. Installing metal roofing is noisy; keep peace with your neighbors by not doing this early on a Sunday morning.

Self-tapping metal screws with washers can also be used to secure the panels.

Overlap the next panel onto the one just installed by one rib (Fig. A). Drive nails into the purlins at that over-lap and every third peak after that. The purlins provide a convenient ladder to work from, so complete all your nailing before you move on to the next panel. When you reach the far end, either cut your panel to the width or increase the overlap so it fits.

To install translucent sky-light panels, first cut and install the small bottom metal panel. Overlap the translucent panel 3 in. onto it (breaking the seams on purlins, as shown in Photo 15) then install the top metal panel, overlapping the trans-lucent panel again by 3 in.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/garden-shed-15-install-translucent-skylight-panels.jpg" alt="" width="637" height="616" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2020" />

<strong>Install translucent skylight panels, over-lapping them onto lower metal panels by 3 or 4 in. Start and stop all panel ends on purlins.</strong>

Install the ridge cap and foam strips (Photo 16) to keep driving rains and insects out and complete the peak.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/garden-shed-16-add-ridge-cap-foam-strip.jpg" alt="" width="637" height="610" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2021" />

<strong>Add ridge cap and foam strip to keep out rain and insects. Nail cap into every third rib. The 2x4 eave blocking at the top of the wall seals gable ends.</strong>

Tuck each 2-ft. long seal strip between the ridge cap and metal panel, then nail the ridge at every second or third peak. To reach the peak, secure triangular roof brackets through the metal roofing and into the purlins using rubber washer nails.

Lay 2x6s across the brackets to stand on. When finished, remove the brackets and pound in the nails. <strong>Metal roofing is slippery, especially on steep slopes like this — don't take chances!</strong>

<h2>DIY Double Dutch Door</h2>

Study Fig. C, Photos 17 through 19 and the text below, then mentally walk through this door project.

If you understand the basic procedure (it is out of the ordinary), give it a whirl — you'll be rewarded with a door that's quaint, unusual, even functional. But if you're not sure, use a square or pre-hung exterior door — they install quickly, are secure and when painted, still look pretty darn good.

Begin by drawing a 36-in. radius arc on two 2x8s. Cut them to shape with a jigsaw, then nail them into the door opening so each is flush with one side of the 2x4 framing.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/garden-shed-fig-c-diy-dutch-door-detail-606x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="941" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2030" />

<strong>Fig. C: Dutch Door Detail</strong>

Sheathe the outer curved 2x8 with 1/2-in. plywood. Nail the two cedar side jambs in place. Create the top jamb by nailing tongue-and-groove cedar lx4s, each 4-1/4 in. long, to the bottom of the curve (Photo 18).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/garden-shed-17-create-framework-jamb-arched-top-dutch-door.jpg" alt="" width="684" height="667" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2022" />

<strong>Create the framework and jamb for the arched-top Dutch door. Short pieces of tongue-and-groove cedar conform to the curve of the arch.</strong>

Nail the 2x4 cedar door trim along each side. Create the top trim by cutting a cedar 2x12 into a "curved 2x4" as shown in Fig. C. Add the 1/2 x 3/4-in. doorstops as shown in Photo 18.

<strong>Install the doorstop and exterior casing. Soak doorstop in water and fabric softener to increase flexibility. The arched casing is cut from 2x12 cedar.</strong>

Soak the upper piece in warm water and fabric softener for 30 minutes beforehand to make it more flexible.

Build the double door by first creating an oversized one-piece door, then cutting it to size and then finally in half. Secure a dozen 7-ft. long tongue-and-groove 1x4s to one another using four 1x3 battens and galvanized dry-wall screws.

Position the middle two battens 36 and 37 in. from the door bottom. Place this oversized door blank in the door opening and trace the opening's shape onto it. Cut the curved top with a jigsaw (Photo 19).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/garden-shed-19-cut-door-to-size.jpg" alt="" width="690" height="673" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2024" />

<strong>Cut door to size. First, copy the outline of opening onto door blank by holding it in the opening, then trace. Cut the curved top, then cut the door in half between the middle two battens.</strong>

Use a circular saw to cut the door to width, then make two cuts to remove the 1-in. space between the two middle battens. Secure the 1x4 ledge to the top of the lower door half. If you want a threshold, install a store-bought or DIY one, then cut off the bottom of the door accordingly.

Set the two door halves in the opening, use shims to separate the top and bottom doors by 1/4 in., then secure the door halves to the jamb with two pairs of strap hinges. Install gate hardware for the latch.

<h2>Simple Windows And Working Shutters</h2>

This project used inexpensive windows — barn sashes ($25 each) — secured to hand-built frames with hinges. They're built and operate like a swinging door.

Use a table saw or hand plane to taper the bottom sill of the frame at 5 degrees to aid water run-off (Fig. D). Build the rest of the frame so the window will sit inside it with a 1/8-in. gap all around. Nail 3/4 x 3/4-in. cedar stops to the sides and top of the frame for the window to close against.

Secure the window to the window frame with face mount hinges (Photo 20), then set this pre-built unit in the window rough opening. Drive wood shims between the rough opening and the window's frame so the 1/8-in. gap remains even around the window sash, then nail the window frame to the surrounding framework.

Secure the handle and simple hook-and-eye latch. Nail 2x4 cedar boards around the outside for trim.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/garden-shed-20-screw-hinges-to-barn-sash-window.jpg" alt="" width="648" height="615" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2025" />

<strong>Screw hinges to the barn sash and window frame. Leave a 1/8-in. gap on all sides so the window can open and close freely. Shim and nail the entire unit into rough window opening.</strong>

The shutters are decorative, but with the use of pintle hinges (Fig. D), can be closed to protect the glass and secure the shed during the off-season. (Pintle hinges can be found in the gate hardware section of your home center.)

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/garden-shed-fig-d-window-and-shutter-detail-1007x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="566" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2032" />

<strong>Fig. D: Window And Shutter Detail</strong>

Build the shutters from three tongue-and-groove cedar boards, fastened side by side, using galvanized screws and 1x3 cleats. Use lag bolts to secure the "spool" part of the pintle hinges to the back side of the shutter and screw the two pins into the window casing.

Position these so the closed shutter will overlap onto the 2x4 cedar casings by about 1 in. Slide the spool over the pin to mount the shutter. Keep them flat against the shed with shutterdogs.

<h2>Siding And Fancy Cuts</h2>

You could apply lap or sheet siding like T1-11, but vertical tongue-and-groove siding gave us the look we wanted. Install the cedar boards starting from the corner. Leave the tongue edge exposed for nailing and for the groove of the next board to slide over (Photo 21).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/garden-shed-21-install-tongue-groove-siding.jpg" alt="" width="699" height="668" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2026" />

<strong>Install the tongue-and-groove siding, cutting notches for rafter tails and the door and window trim. Nail siding to studs with 8d galvanized casing nails.</strong>

Notch the boards to slide up and around the rafter tails or around the windows and doors as necessary. Let the siding “run wild” (extra-long at the bottom), then go back, snap a chalk line on the siding 5 in. up from the bottom of the plywood wall sheathing and trim with a circular saw. Nail 2x6s to cover the end grain at the bottom of the siding.

The geometric shingles, shown in Photo 22, are purely for decoration. Use them as accents at gable ends or below windows. They're available in a variety of shapes and can be applied in many eye-catching patterns.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/garden-shed-22-nail-decorative-shingles.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="616" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2027" />

<strong>Nail the decorative shingles on gable ends. Apply two coats of paint, stain or clear preservative to all siding, then caulk.</strong>

Preserve the natural appearance of the cedar by coating it with clear wood finish — or prime the exterior, then paint it with two coats of high-quality latex paint.

<h2>The Shed Interior</h2>

For a solid, smooth floor, add a layer of 5/8 in. plywood over the treated plywood. Stagger the seams and secure it to the joists with 2-in. drywall screws.

Paint the floor to protect it from water and gardening messes.

Prime and paint the interior walls to brighten them and cover the inevitable lumber stamps and color variations.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/garage-workbench-1024x785.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="427" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-973" />

Custom create your own interior with workbenches, shelves, hooks, storage bins, and cabinets (<a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/garage-workbench-plans/">click here for more ideas and detailed instructions</a>).

The space above and between the trusses can be used to store lightweight, seldom used items. Electricity and water can be run to the shed for your convenience.

Kick back and light up a carrot — you're done.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Convicted of "Wrongful Disposal of Yard and Garden Waste" — how's that going to look on your next job application? Sound far-fetched? Well, many communities from Florida to Oregon now prohibit the disposal of leaves. branches, garden waste and grass clippings in landfills already close to overflowing.

What to do? One option is to turn that waste into useful (or at least smaller) <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/mulching/">mulch</a> and compost with a chipper-shredder. Whether you rent, buy or borrow, there are right and wrong ways to operate these machines.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/chipper-shredder-00-opening.jpg" alt="" width="690" height="494" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2039" />

<strong>Chip and shred leaves, branches, grass and garden clippings. These machines can reduce a stack of debris to a pile a tenth its original size.</strong>

Here's a primer.

<h2>What does a wood chipper-shredder do? How do chipper-shredders operate?</h2>

Chippers, shredders, mulchers, grinders — whatever name or combination of names they go by — do only one thing, but they do it well. They reduce branches, leaves, grass and other organic matter into small chips or flakes.

Most large, gas-powered units, like the ones examined here, are actually <strong>two machines in one</strong>:

<ol><li>The smaller portion consists of a <strong>hopper</strong> into which leaves, grass clippings and small twigs are fed. Rapidly rotating teeth or hammers beneath the hopper cut or smash these materials into small pieces.</li>
<li>The <strong>chipper</strong> consists of a chute into which branches (up to 3 or 4 in. in diameter) are fed. A heavy wheel with one or more heavy-duty cutting teeth chips branches into small pieces. All the materials stay in the grinding chamber (Photo 4) until they're small enough to pass through the discharge screen.</li></ol>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/chipper-shredder-04-change-discharge-screens.jpg" alt="" width="573" height="488" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2043" />

<strong>Change discharge screens to grind materials to different sizes. The reducing screen will give you wood chips and minimize clogging. The composting screen will give you finely ground material but it increases the likelihood of clogging.</strong>

<h2>How much does a chipper-shredder cost?</h2>

There are three main types of chipper-shredders:

<ol><li><strong>Small electric shredders cost around $450</strong>. They can handle leaves, grass clippings and twigs from a small yard — but don't expect them to handle branches larger than about 1 in. in diameter.</li>
<li><strong>On the middle category, chipper-shredders start from $750</strong>. These offer the best cost-benefit ratio if you have a mammoth yard or passion for collecting large tools. Stockpile the debris you want to "cut down to size," then set aside one autumn and one spring day for chipping. You can do a heap of work in a few hours.</li>
<li><strong>Even bigger machines have a vacuum attachment and will cost you up to $2,300</strong>. They are great if your garden has an overwhelming amount of leaves (Photo 5).</li></ol>

<strong>Lotsa leaves? Use a machine with a vacuum attachment and bagging accessory for quick pick-up and easy use (or disposal).</strong>

<h2>7 Tips To Safely Use A Chipper-Shredder</h2>

You'll see warning stickers and safety devices galore because the tremendous power of these machines makes them inherently dangerous. Read and follow all manuals and bear in mind:

<ul><li>When the instructions say stay in the "safety zone," they mean it (Photo 1). Half-digested pieces of wood and debris are often kicked out through the chipper chute and shredding hopper.</li></ul>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/chipper-shredder-01-stay-in-the-safety-zone.jpg" alt="" width="663" height="739" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2040" />

<strong>Stay in the safety zone (and wear ear and eye protection). Avoid being hit by debris discharged through the chute or hopper by staying within the designated zones.</strong>

<ul><li>Keep the machine on level ground, preferably a soft surface. They're noisier and more likely to move around on concrete or asphalt surfaces.</li>

<li>Watch what you feed your machine. Hidden rocks, wire and steel stakes can dull cutters, damage drive shafts, and harm you.</li></ul>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/chipper-shredder-02-use-a-push-stick.jpg" alt="" width="542" height="539" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2041" />

<strong>Use a push stick to feed short pieces through the chipping hopper. Hands or arms should never enter the hopper or chute. Hidden rocks, wire, and steel stakes can dull cutters, damage drive shafts, and harm you.</strong>

<ul><li>Never run a branch larger than what the manufacturer specifies through the chipper or shredder. And don't give the machine too much, too fast — <strong>overfeeding is the most common reason these machines bog or break down</strong>.</li>

<li>Wear <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/eye-protection/">goggles, a face shield or safety glasses with side shields</a>. <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/hearing-protection/">Hearing protection</a> and gloves are other necessities.</li>

<li>Keep your arms perpendicular to the hopper and hold branches loosely, so your arms aren't pulled in.</li>

<li>Before changing the screen (Photo 4) or cleaning out the machine, wait until the machine is completely stopped, then pull off the spark plug wire.</li></ul>

<h2>7 Tips & Lessons I Learned Operating A Chipper-Shredder</h2>

Last spring I used a variety of chipper-shredders. While running tree limbs, leaves, pine needles, cornstalks and grass clippings through the machines, I learned:

<ul><li>Make sure the machine you use is equipped with sharp chipping knives. One I rented had dull teeth; chipping a 4-ft. long branch was a bone-rattling, tough, lengthy task. I finally quit Other machines I used had sharp chipping knives; branches smoothly disappeared like carrots through a juicer. Green branches chip easier than dry ones.</li>

<li>The shredding teeth really grab ahold of branches and yank them through the hopper. Be ready for this. Make sure your hands aren't entangled and that your face won't be slapped by branches being pulled in.</li>

<li>The fingers or flaps on the trap doors (Photo 1) loosen and separate as the machines age; ground-up debris tends to fly back out of the machine through the hopper and the chute. Keep a bed of leaves in the hopper while grinding, to slow these flying chips.</li>

<li>When shredding green leaves or garden waste, occasionally run a few small dry sticks through the shredder. This helps clean off green stringy stuff that clings to the shredding teeth and shaft. If the machine clogs frequently, use a reducing screen (Photo 4), or if the manufacturer allows it, take off the screen entirely.</li>

<li>Use the fat end of a big plastic bat or a forked stick to push leaves through the safety fingers and into the shred-ding chamber (Photo 3). This keeps your hands well out of harm's way.</li></ul>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/chipper-shredder-03-feed-leaves-with-leaf-tamper.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="495" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2042" />

<strong>Feed leaves and garden clippings through the hop-per using a plastic baseball bat, forked stick or manufacturer-supplied leaf tamper. Mix green and dry materials together to keep the material and the machine running freely.</strong>

<ul><li>Many manufacturers offer both 5- and 8-hp gas models. Given the choice, get the larger one. The smaller ones are more likely to clog and bog than the 8-hp workhorses, which rarely seem to falter.</li>

<li>If your machine does clog, wait until it stops, then pull off the spark plug wire and lower the discharge screen (Photo 4). Use a stick to rake debris out of the grinding chamber and away from the discharge area outside the machine.</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Stop Backdrafting In Your Home Now</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One evening early last winter, I caught a distinct whiff of ashes as I relaxed in my living room. The scent was coming from the fireplace, although no fire was burning and both the damper in the chimney and the glass doors were closed.

The rumble of the clothes dryer downstairs supplied the clue we needed to explain the mystery. The dryer, because it vents to the outside, was sucking the air out of the house. Some of the <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/fresh-air-indoors/">replacement air</a> was coming in down the chimney and leaking around the damper and glass doors, carrying the telltale scent of ashes with it.

This was a good example of "backdrafting," a reversal of the normal airflow in a chimney. Usually, air flows upward, drawn by the wind outdoors or by the natural buoyancy of warm air.

In fact, it's critical that your home can depend on this natural updraft in the chimney flues to carry out smoke from the fireplace as well as fumes from furnaces and water heaters that burn natural gas, oil or propane. (Electric appliances do not create fumes.)

But sometimes, like that evening in my home, something disturbs the natural updraft and causes it to reverse and flow downward. You'll likely sense this backdraft immediately if you have a fire in the fireplace; the room will quickly fill with smoke.

Usually, you can restore the updraft by opening a window or door a crack. This allows outside air to rush in and restore the natural updraft in the chimney.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/stopping-backdrafting-fig-a-tight-house-744x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="767" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2048" />

<strong>When exhaust fans operate in a tightly built house (one with little air leakage around doors, windows and other areas), replacement air can come down the chimney and cause the combustion fumes from a furnace, water heater or fireplace to spill inside. These fumes might contain deadly <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/check-carbon-monoxide-at-home/">carbon monoxide</a>.</strong>

But if it's a furnace or water heater that's backdrafting, you can be in serious — even deadly — trouble. That's because chances are that you won't see or smell the fumes spilling into the house.

While oil, natural gas, and propane burn cleaner than wood, their exhaust fumes might contain carbon monoxide, an odorless, colorless gas that can kill you if it reaches high enough levels. Furthermore, backdrafting can lead to moisture buildup in your home and the growth of mold, mildew, and rot.

Backdrafting is a threat to the health of your family and your house. In this article, I'll tell you what causes it, how to detect it, and how to prevent it. 

<h2>What is backdrafting? Why is it a problem?</h2>

Backdrafting became an increasing problem after the energy crisis of 1973 when gas lines and rising fuel prices made <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/blower-door-test/">energy conservation</a> a high priority.

Homes in those days had lots of air leaking in and out through cracks around doors, windows, and foundations and through the ceiling and attic. Builders didn't plan the leakage; it simply happened in the course of construction. You couldn't complain.

Leaks supplied plenty of replacement air to keep the natural chimney drafts flowing upward. Of course, leaky houses wasted a lot of energy — heat in winter and cooled air in the summer — but that didn't matter much until fuel costs rose so dramatically.

The push for energy-efficient homes is gradually making the leaky home obsolete. Better insulation, tight-fitting windows, weathertight doors, caulking and weather-stripping, and other energy-conserving improvements sharply reduced air leakage.

To our surprise, they cut down on drafts and made homes more comfortable too!

As a result, most homes now have less replacement air available to keep those natural drafts flowing up the chimney flues. This was the case in my home, where I had recently insulated the walls and caulked around the foundation to reduce air leakage.

Besides this trend toward tighter homes, a second key factor also contributes to backdrafting — an increase in both the number and size of ventilation fans:

You probably now have an exhaust fan in every bathroom and in the kitchen to flush out odors and moisture. Those downdraft fans connected to ranges are particularly powerful.

Every time you switch on the kitchen or bathroom fan or turn on the clothes dryer for that matter, you suck air out of your house, air that the chimney might need to sustain its natural updraft.

If the updraft fails, or for that matter, if the fans actually pull air down the chimney (Fig. A), your furnace, water heater, and fireplace might backdraft and dump their dangerous fumes into your house.

<h2>How do I test my house for backdrafting?</h2>

Fortunately, you can easily test your furnace and water heater for backdrafting.

Set up a worst-case scenario by closing up your house as you would during cold weather or during hot weather when the air conditioner is running full time:

<ul><li>Shut and fasten all your windows and doors tightly,</li>
<li>Close the fireplace damper (if you have one),</li>
<li>Then turn on the kitchen and bathroom fans and clothes dryer.</li></ul>

In real life, you probably won't have all these on at once, but you want to set up the worst possible case.

Now start the furnace (by turning up the thermostat) or water heater (by turning on a hot (by turning on a hot water faucet until you hear the burner go on).

After a minute, locate the draft diverter above the water heater or furnace (Fig. B) and hold a lighted or smoking match near its edge.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/stopping-backdrafting-fig-b-checking.jpg" alt="" width="573" height="479" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2049" />

<strong>Hold a lighted match by the edge of the draft diverter on your furnace or water heater. The flame and smoke should be drawn up the flue if it's venting properly.</strong>

Newer furnaces have rectangular draft diverters on the front, as shown in Fig. C, rather than on top. The flame and smoke should be drawn into and up the draft diverter if the flue is drawing properly.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/stopping-backdrafting-fig-c-combustion-air-supply.jpg" alt="" width="741" height="979" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2050" />

<strong>An open duct placed near the furnace and water heater ensures that adequate air is available for combustion and venting. The ".1" at the end of the duct slows unwanted drafts.</strong>

If the flame or smoke is not drawn to the flue, or is blown away from it, you have a backdrafting problem.

Turn off your furnace and water heater or open a nearby window and then call your local utility or a heating specialist for a professional evaluation. Sometimes backdrafting is caused by chimney blockages or factors other than inadequate replacement air. A professional evaluation will get to the root of the problem.

Do the smoking match test routinely whenever you improve the energy efficiency of your house. Even replacing a couple of old, leaky windows with new, tight ones can upset the sometimes delicate balance of airflow through your house and cause backdrafting.

<h2>How to stop and eliminate backdrafting in my home?</h2>

The simplest way to prevent backdrafting is to provide a source of replacement air (also called combustion air) for your furnace, water heater and fireplace to replace the air that flows up the chimney with the exhaust fumes (Fig. C).

In fact, building codes in many regions require the addition of a special replacement air duct when you replace a furnace.

You can purchase both a screened wall vent (to keep critters out but not block the air flow) and insulated flexible duct for a fresh air supply at a heating and cooling supplies dealer.

Generally, codes require that you size the incoming air duct to match the combined heating output of your furnace and water heater, so check with your local code official for exact size requirements.

If it's time to replace your furnace or water heater, you can choose two other strategies that builders sometimes use in new, energy-efficient homes.

One is to install an "induced draft" furnace or water heater, which simply means that the exhaust flue includes a built-in fan that blows the fumes up the chimney. In this way, it can successfully compete with other exhaust fans in the house.

Another solution is to install a "closed" or "sealed" combustion furnace or water heater, which draws its combustion air directly from outside through a pipe and expels the fumes outside as well. It neither relies on a natural draft chimney nor draws on air from inside your home.

These sealed combustion appliances may well be the systems of the future, as home builders and buyers push for higher energy efficiency in new homes.

As you might expect, both the induced draft and closed combustion systems cost more than those that rely on natural drafts.

<h2>How do I stop backdrafting in a chimney?</h2>

Supplying replacement air to fireplaces is a tougher chore.

Newer ones often have an outside air supply already installed that you manually open when you start a fire. But old ones, especially masonry fire-places, rarely have an outside air supply.

Since installing a supply is usually difficult and expensive, discuss your particular situation with a fireplace builder, and be sure to confirm any retrofit plans with a local building inspector before making changes.

It's often easier to ensure a good natural draft by slightly opening a window in the same room as the fireplace while the fire is burning, and keeping it open until the embers are completely out.

<h2>Why bother with backdrafting and building new ducts?</h2>

it might strike you as odd that after tightening up your house to make it more energy efficient, you intentionally create big, new air leaks with ducts. Why bother tightening the house in the first place?

Installing air supply ducts actually wastes less energy than you might imagine. They reduce the amount of air leaking in from other sources and channel much of the incoming air to the combustion chamber, draft diverter and the flue of your furnace or water heater.

The result is less inside air that's already either heated or cooled is lost up the chimney. The energy cost still comes out in your favor. And you'll make your home healthier and more comfortable as well as more energy efficient.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>How to Install Sod Correctly - 5 Tools, 6 Steps, &amp; 7 Tips</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s not the easiest project you'll ever try. You'll sweat, get really dirty and have a tired back when you're finished. But for a great-looking "instant" lawn, or if you're redoing some of the landscaping around your yard, you'll have to lay sod.

To make sure that your time and dollar investment is a success, you need to know more than just "green side up." But don't worry. The steps are straightforward and easy to understand and it's one project that's doable by even the greenest DIYer.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2054" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/laying-sod-00-opening.jpg" alt="" width="631" height="629" />
<h2>When Is The Best Time Of The Year To Lay Sod?</h2>
<strong>The two recommended times to lay sod are the early spring or late fall.</strong>

Either season allows for strong root growth so they're firmly established into the soil before the hot summer sun or winter's icy blast can damage them.

And if the roots have a strong start, you'll have a great-looking lawn for the future.
<h2>How To Test Your Soil pH</h2>
If your grass looks like you just finished hosting one of the World Cup Soccer games or it just plain looks sick, the problem may be the dirt under your lawn.

Dig some random soil samples and have them tested for their pH level. The pH determines whether a soil is sweet (alkaline) or sour (acid) and it affects how well grass will grow.

Most county extension services will test soil for a small fee. You can also buy a soil-testing kit at your local hardware store or nursery.
<h2>What Does My Soil pH Mean?</h2>
The pH level of soil ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. <strong>Most lawns do best when the pH is between 6.5 and 7.</strong>

Here’s how to interpret your pH soil level:
<ul>
 	<li>If the pH level is from 0 to 5, the soil is high in acid.</li>
 	<li>If the pH level is 8 or higher, the soil is alkaline.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How To Adjust Your Soil pH</h2>
If the pH level is acid, you should add lime to it to reduce its acidity and raise the level closer to 7.

If the pH level is 8 or higher, the soil is alkaline, and you should add dusting sulfur to increase its acidity.

Lime and sulfur are sold at nurseries and garden centers. Have the folks at the nursery help you determine how much lime or sulfur to add.

The amount is determined by the pH level and the square footage you'll be resodding. The best time to add lime or sulfur is when you're adding topsoil.
<h2>What Tools And Materials Do You Need To Lay Sod?</h2>
You probably have most of these items on hand:
<ul>
 	<li>a metal garden rake,</li>
 	<li>a utility knife,</li>
 	<li>a hammer,</li>
 	<li>some heavy work gloves, and</li>
 	<li>work boots.</li>
</ul>
You'll need to rent a gas-powered, rotary tiller to turn under the old grass and to work the new topsoil and lime or sulfur into the dirt.

You'll also need to rent a drum roller to flatten or tamp the sod in place once it has been laid.

For materials, you'll need:
<ul>
 	<li>sod,</li>
 	<li>topsoil (not black dirt — there is a difference, so keep reading),</li>
 	<li>some starter fertilizer, and</li>
 	<li>if your lawn has some hills or slopes that will be resodded, a couple of 1x2s to cut into short stakes to hold the sod on the hill while the roots take hold.</li>
</ul>
<h2>6 Steps To Lay Sod Yourself (With Pictures)</h2>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Turn under the old sod with a gas-powered rotary tiller. Make several passes in a crisscross pattern to chop the old sod and turn over the soil. Once the sod and soil are thoroughly mixed, add the topsoil and nutrients (lime or sulfur) and work them in with the tiller. Keep tilling until the soil is clump-free.</strong>

</ol>
<ol start="2">
 	<li><strong>Smooth the tilled soil with a metal garden rake. You want the soil to be as smooth as possible, so there won't be any lumps or valleys under the new sod. This is the time to change the slope or grade of the landscape if desired. Now spread lawn starter fertilizer on top of the soil to stimulate rapid grass root growth.</strong>

</ol>
<ol start="3">
 	<li><strong>Lay the new sod in place. Make sure each new roll butts tightly against the neighboring roll to minimize seam lines. Cut some rolls shorter so the ends form a staggered or running-bond pattern, the same pattern you see in a brick or concrete block wall. The staggered end seams also reduce erosion and runoff.</strong>

</ol>
<ol start="4">
 	<li><strong>Cut the sod with a utility knife when patching. You'll need to patch whenever you're working around a driveway, as we are, or <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/dry-laid-patio/">sidewalks</a>, trees, and other landscape elements. Lay complete rolls of sod first, then cut smaller pieces to fit.</strong>

<h2>7 Tips To Lay Sod</h2>
I didn't show you each step because some are obvious. There are some things, however, that need explanation:
<ol>
 	<li>Before you begin tilling, check with your local utility companies (gas, electric, telephone, and cable TV) for any underground wires, pipes or cables. You won't be tilling deeper than 5 or 6 in., but it's best to be safe. Most utility companies will come out at no charge to mark the locations. Also, note the location of underground pipes and spray heads if your lawn has an in-ground sprinkler system.</li>
 	<li>Don't buy the sod too early. Pick it up or have it delivered, depending on how much you need, the day it'll be laid. Rolled-up sod won't last for more than a couple of days. Keep the rolls of unlaid sod wet by misting them with a garden hose, especially if you can't get it all laid in a day.</li>
 	<li>Before ordering the sod, check with the supplier to make sure that the sod is freshly cut. Don't accept delivery if it's dry, wilted or yellowed—all signs that the sod is not freshly cut. Go ahead and unroll a couple of rolls and check it out before accepting it. Sod is sold by the roll or "yard" — a roll covers 1 sq. yd.</li>
 	<li>Buy topsoil instead of black dirt. Topsoil is pulverized and virtually free of clumps, so you'll spend less time tilling it into the old soil. Black dirt has clumps and takes longer to work in.</li>
 	<li>Once the new sod has been laid, water, water, water. You can't overwater new sod. And stay off it for at least three weeks!
Many people walk on the sod after a day or two just to see how it's doing. Wrong, wrong, wrong! Walking on it will make deep depressions (even ankle deep!) in the sod. This also weakens the root structure and slows root growth.</li>
 	<li>Don't be in a hurry to mow the new grass either. Wait at least four to six weeks before mowing for the first time. When you do cut it, don't cut more than one-third of the grass blade length at a time. Cutting too much at once stresses the grass and roots.</li>
 	<li>Photo 5 shows a large area of old sod that had to be removed to even out the grade levels between the lawn and a new driveway. When you're leveling, don't be afraid to cut out existing sod and then remove some of the dirt too. You don't want steep, sudden height changes between surfaces. They're hard to maintain and unsafe to walk on.</li>
</ol>
The quickest way to cut out old sod is with a rented sod kicker. It looks like an old-fashioned, horse-drawn plow, but it has a sharp metal blade that slices off the sod and about 1 in. of dirt.

And a final bonus tip: be sure to keep the blade sharp. You'll know when the blade is getting dull because you'll be kicking harder to make it cut. A few strokes with a metal file on the cutting blade should sharpen it.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>DIY How To Resurface Hardwood Floors Without Sanding</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Wood floors are tough, but years of shuffling foot-steps, fast-moving kids, high heels and sliding chairs take their toll, leaving scuffs, scratches, stains, ground-in grit and a dulled surface in their wake.

But you can restore the beauty of your wood floor without the cost and mess of completely sanding off the old finish and starting over. Instead, you can often simply recoat the old finish. 

<h2>How Much Does It Cost To Refinish A Hardwood Floor?</h2>

A pro would charge from $4.00 per sq. ft. for sanding and refinishing, or about $1.50 per sq. ft. for recoating. In this article, I'll show you how to do it for much less.

<h2>Can You Redo Your Hardwood Floors Without Sanding?</h2>

A recoating job is a two-step process:

<ol><li>First you lightly sand the surface of the old finish using a floor buffing machine and a special sanding screen, shown in Photo 5. (You can rent a buffing machine for half or full day.)</li>
<li>Then you apply a topcoat of finish.</li></ol>

The process sounds easy, and it is. But it'll work only if you're sure that the new coat will bond to the old. You shouldn't have any adhesion problems if your floor was finished with the polyurethane finishes commonly used after about 1970, as long as it was never waxed.

Wax is a refinisher's nightmare. Once a floor has been waxed, a pro won't guarantee that a new topcoat will adhere, even if you do your best to strip off the wax. In these cases, completely sand off the old finish and start over. If you're unsure about your finish, be sure to test it as I show in the next section, "Testing for Adhesion."

Floors finished before 1970 were sometimes finished with a hard wax coating. Although you can't use the resurfacing process shown here for these floors, don't despair.

If waxed floors aren't deeply scratched or gouged, you can often simply clean, rewax and buff them to restore their beauty. A specialty wood flooring dealer will give you maintenance advice and sell you the proper floor care products.

Wax is not the only product that can keep a new topcoat from adhering. Cleaning products that leave an oily or waxy residue, grease, bug spray (for ants or termites), and such oddball things as spilled wallpaper paste can all ruin adhesion. If you suspect the presence of any of these materials or are unsure how your floor has been maintained, be sure to test your floor as I show.

Finally, don't expect a new topcoat to solve all floor problems. Deep gouges, scratches, burns, animal stains and color variations all require special fixes, or possibly a complete floor sanding.

<h2>How Do I Test Wooden Floors For Topcoat Adhesion?</h2>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wood-floor-renewal-09-test-adhesion-01.jpg" alt="" width="455" height="550" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2071" />

<ol><li>Using a cleaner specifically formulated for wood floors, clean at least two 6-in. square sections of floor, one near a wall and the other in a high-traffic area.</li>
<li>Tape off the sections and sand each lightly with a 100-grit screen or sand-paper to roughen the surface. (Like sandpaper, screens are coated with grit, but they don't clog up as easily.)</li>
<li>Wipe off the dust and coat each section with oil-based (technically called oil-modified) polyurethane or a water-based urethane.</li>
<li>Wait one day.</li></ol>

After 24 hours, check the adhesion by scratching the topcoat with a quarter or your fingernail.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wood-floor-renewal-09-test-adhesion-02.jpg" alt="" width="563" height="605" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2072" />

If it flakes off or separates from the old finish, you have an adhesion problem and you'll have to completely sand off the old finish and start over.

<h2>How Do You Prepare Hardwood Flooring For A Recoat?</h2>

If you're lucky and find that you can recoat your floor successfully, remove all the furniture and clean the floor using a cleaner specifically formulated for wood floors (Photo 1) or a mixture of 1/4 cup of white vinegar and a quart of water. If you purchase a cleaner, buy from a wood floor dealer to make sure you get the best stuff available.

<strong>Reminder</strong>: Wood and water don't mix. Be sure to dampen the cloth, not the floor, with the cleaners.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wood-floor-renewal-01-wipe-cleaner-scrape-gunk.jpg" alt="" width="599" height="494" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2063" />

<strong>Wipe the floor with a cleaner specifically formulated for wood floors. Spray the cleaner on a cloth, not directly on the floor. Scrape up stuck-on paint or gunk with a putty knife. Keep an eye out for scratches, ridges or other mars in the wood.</strong>

While cleaning, inspect your floor for scuffs, scratches and other problems that need special attention (Photos 2 and 3).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wood-floor-renewal-02-remove-stubborn-stains.jpg" alt="" width="676" height="455" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2064" />

<strong>Remove stubborn stains and marks with a 100-grit screen or a nylon scrub pad and mineral spirits if necessary. Do not use water. Deep scratches can mean trouble, because they might discolor when recoated. Lightly sand and rub some new finish into the scratches to see if they'll disappear (Photo 3).</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wood-floor-renewal-03-lightly-sand-deep-scratches.jpg" alt="" width="675" height="407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2065" />

<strong>Lightly sand deep scratches in unstained floors with a screen and rub some polyurethane over the area to see if the scratches will dis-appear when recoated. Restain scratches in a stained floor.</strong>

If they still look bad, you'll have to sand the entire floor to hide them.

<strong>Problem</strong>: Deep scratches in a dark-stained floor are an eyesore, and they're difficult to hide. To match the original stain, begin with a lighter stain, because the color will probably deepen when the damaged wood absorbs it. Or call in a wood flooring pro to handle repairs.

If your floor is stained, keep a watchful eye out for uneven or warped boards when you clean it. Screening the floor with the buffing machine, like we show in Photo 5, will cut through the stain at the high points, expose the natural wood color and ruin the floor's appearance. To prevent this, you can screen the entire stained floor by hand, which is a big job, but still simpler than resanding and starting over.

<h2>Wooden Floor Screening And Finishing</h2>

Screening the floor slightly roughens the surface of the old finish so the new finish adheres better. Roughen the edges first with 100-grit screen.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wood-floor-renewal-04-roughen-floor-edges.jpg" alt="" width="676" height="517" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2066" />

<strong>Roughen the floor edges with a 100-grit screen until the floor sur-face appears chalky or frosted. Wear gloves to protect your hands.</strong>

Then, screen the entire floor with a buffing machine and the special attachments that the rental store will supply: a drive brush, a special pad and a 100-grit disc screen.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wood-floor-renewal-05-center-buffer-roughen-surface.jpg" alt="" width="717" height="647" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2067" />

<strong>Center the buffer on a 100-grit round screen and roughen the surface of the floor finish evenly. Move the buffer back and forth in the direction of the wood strips until the finish has an evenly chalky appearance. Keep the buffer moving, so it won't cut through the finish into the wood.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wood-floor-renewal-06-lift-buffer-check-screen.jpg" alt="" width="691" height="519" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2068" />

<strong>Lift the buffer and carefully check the screen every few minutes for grit. Clean off any particles you find because they'll scratch and gouge the floor finish.</strong>

<strong>Tip</strong>: Buffing machines are heavy, awkward and powerful. If you haven't used one before, learn to control it by attaching the drive brush and operating the machine on smooth, clean concrete. (Make sure to knock any grit out of the brush before putting it on your wood floor. Grit particles can severely scratch a wood floor.)

As you screen the floor, keep the buffer moving to keep the screen from cutting through the finish. The finish should look chalky or frosted after the disc passes over it.

<strong>Tip</strong>: Hard finishes should not gum up the screen. If the screen clogs up, you probably have wax or oil on the floor and cannot use the surface refinishing method we're describing here.

Screens slowly wear down, so buy several and return the unused ones to the rental store when you return the buffing machine.

When finished, vacuum the floor thoroughly and wipe it clean (Photo 7), because any dust left will show up in the new finish — guaranteed! Dispose of thinner-soaked rags by letting them dry in the open air before throwing them in the open air before throwing them into the trash.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wood-floor-renewal-07-vacuum-thoroughly-wipe-off-dust.jpg" alt="" width="690" height="547" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2069" />

<strong>Vacuum the floor thoroughly and wipe off the dust with a cloth dampened with mineral spirits (if you're going to recoat with oil-based polyurethane) or with water (if you're recoating with a water-based urethane).</strong>

<h2>A Word About Floor Finishes</h2>

Oil-based polyurethane is the easiest finish to apply. It's virtually goof-proof, but contains solvents, so wear a painting respirator that has a charcoal filter and ventilate the room well when you spread it.

Water-based urethanes contain little solvent but are more difficult to apply because they have a watery consistency and dry quickly. You have to work faster and take care not to leave ridges when you spread them. Buy special spreading pads from the flooring store where you purchase the finish.

<strong>Apply one coat of oil-based poly-urethane or water-based urethane. Whichever you choose, make sure it's specifically formulated for floors.</strong>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Working With Plastic Pipe</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Working with the old cast iron and threaded galvanized pipe in a home can certainly mark a low point in a DIYer career. Pipes are tough to get apart and even worse to reconnect because you never have the exact lengths you need. Copper pipe makes the job easier, although you have to learn the required soldering skills.

Then plastic pipe arrived – what an ideal DIY material! You can cut and assemble it without special tools and you can master the joining process in the time it takes to read this article. What's more, plastic pipe is inexpensive, won't rust, lasts almost indefinitely, and its smooth interior surface allows water and waste to flow better than in metal pipes. It's a choice DIY material.

Ah, but there are still some tricks you need to know. In this article, you’ll see how to cut, join and support plastic pipe so you can install long-lasting, trouble-free plumbing lines.

<h2>Following Code, Planning, And Execution</h2>

Keep in mind that while installing a plastic drain or water line is relatively easy, planning one is not. To plan one you have to figure out pipe sizes, slopes, vent locations, and other important factors. These details won't be covered here.

Also, be aware that local plumbing codes sometimes prohibit the use of some types of plastic pipe in some situations. Always confirm your plans with the local plumbing inspector before you start a project.

<h2>Types Of Plastic Pipe And Their Uses</h2>

You'll commonly find any of four types of plastic pipe used in homes (see the chart below). Few people can remember their tongue-twisting chemical names, so they use their more familiar initials — ABS, PVC, CPVC and PB.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/working-with-plastic-pipe-00-abs-pvc-cpvc-pb.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="696" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2076" />

<ul><li><strong>ABS</strong>. Rigid, black pipe used for drains and vents; available in sizes between 1-1/2 in. and 4 in.; solvent-welded joints.</li>
<li><strong>PVC</strong>. Rigid, white pipe used for drains and vents and also cold water lines, but not hot; available in sizes between 1/2 in. and 4 in.; requires primer (purple) for solvent-welded joints.</li>
<li><strong>CPVC</strong>. Rigid, cream-colored pipe used for hot and cold water supply lines; normally used in sizes 1 in. and smaller; requires primer (purple) for solvent-welded joints.</li>
<li><strong>PB (polybutylene)</strong>. Flexible, usually gray pipe used for hot and cold water lines; normally used in sizes 1 in. and smaller; joined with special compression fittings. Since PB is less common than CPVC, and since you join it differently than the other three, I'll only talk about PB briefly. </li></ul>

You'll probably find several other types of plastic pipe in your local home center as well. Polyethylene, a flexible black pipe, is commonly used for lawn and plant irrigation. PVC "pressure" pipe is the same PVC pipe as above, but its fittings are heavier duty for such uses as connecting swimming pool pumps. We won't deal with either of these two types here.

If you have trouble identifying any type of plastic pipe or fitting by color, look for its initials printed or stamped somewhere on the plastic.

<h2>Cutting And Fitting Plastic Pipe</h2>

Plastic pipe is ready-made for the DIYer. The fittings all have precisely molded "hubs," enlarged ends into which you slide the pipe (Photo 8). Simply remember to include the hub depth when you measure the length of each section of pipe (Photo 1).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/working-with-plastic-pipe-01-measure-correct-length.jpg" alt="" width="643" height="491" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2077" />

<strong>Measure the correct pipe length with a tape or hold a section in place and mark it. In either case, be sure to include the depth of the hub.</strong>

You can easily cut plastic pipe with a fine-tooth (about 14 teeth per inch) handsaw. However, don't attempt to cut it with a narrow-blade hacksaw; your cut will wander out of square.

Make your cuts at exact right angles so that when two lengths are joined, you don't leave interior gaps that can slow water flow or collect debris. Use a miter box to help make that square cut (Photo 2).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/working-with-plastic-pipe-02-cut-perfectly-square.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="551" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2078" />

<strong>Cut the pipe off perfectly square using a miter box and a fine-tooth handsaw (about 14 teeth per inch works well).</strong>

A power miter box is ideal. Plumbers usually make their square cuts freehand (no miter box) and do it accurately enough because they've had lots of practice.

<strong>Tip</strong>: Cut completely through the pipe to avoid chipping off the last 1/16 in. Use a half-round file or sandpaper to bevel the edges slightly, allowing the pipe to nest into the hub more precisely (Photos 3 and 8)

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/working-with-plastic-pipe-03-remove-burr.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="553" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2079" />

<strong>Remove the burr left by the saw with a file or sandpaper. Bevel the edges slightly for a smoother fit.</strong>

Cut and "dry fit" (put together without glue) the pipe and fittings until you complete an entire run. Then mark the pipes and fittings to make sure they line up again when you glue them together (Photo 4).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/working-with-plastic-pipe-03-remove-burr.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="553" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2079" />

<strong>Assemble the fittings and pipe without glue ("dry fit"). Mark the proper positioning with a felt-tip pen. If joints stick together when you disassemble the run, tap them with a hammer and wood block.</strong>

Watch out: Sometimes while dry-fitting, pipes and hubs fit so precisely that you can't completely seat the pipe in the hub. This can throw off your measurements farther down the pipe run. If your joints don't completely seat, cut, fit and glue three or four fittings at a time, rather than trying to dry-fit the entire run at one time.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/working-with-plastic-pipe-04-dry-fit-mark-positioning.jpg" alt="" width="636" height="558" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2080" />

<strong>Tip</strong>: Dry-fit pipes and fittings can stick together so tightly that you might have a devil of a time pulling them apart. If so, whack the fittings with a wooden block and hammer (Photo 4).

<h2>Gluing Plastic Pipe</h2>

The gluing process is properly called "solvent welding." The solvent melts the plastic, so when you push the pipe and hub together, the two pieces fuse as the solvent evaporates.

<strong>Tip</strong>: Each type of plastic has its own solvent. While some solvents work on several types of plastic, it's best to buy the type meant solely for the plastic you're working with.

For the solvent to work, the surfaces to be joined must be clean—free of dirt, grease, and moisture. Wipe the inside of the hub and the ends of the pipe with a clean cloth. Then apply a special, purple cleaner/primer to PVC and CPVC (Photo 5). ABS does not require a primer.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/working-with-plastic-pipe-05-spread-special-purple-primer.jpg" alt="" width="611" height="582" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2081" />

<strong>Spread special purple primer on the hubs and pipe ends of PVC and CPVC. This isn't necessary with ABS pipe.</strong>

Next coat the surfaces to be joined liberally with the proper solvent (Photo 6).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/working-with-plastic-pipe-06-apply-solvent-over-primer.jpg" alt="" width="608" height="578" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2082" />

<strong>Spread the proper solvent liberally on the inside of the hub and the outer pipe surface.</strong>

Ventilate well or wear an <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/respirators/">organic fume respirator</a>, because this stuff gives off powerful fumes. Quickly push the pipe into the fitting, giving the pipe a quarter of a revolution twist to make sure the pipe seats full depth in the hub (Photo 8).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/working-with-plastic-pipe-07-push-together-hold-tight.jpg" alt="" width="810" height="587" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2083" />

<strong>Push the hub and pipe together quickly, making a quarter turn in one to seat the pipe fully in the hub. Align the positioning marks and hold tightly for 15 seconds.</strong>

Align your marks as you twist the joint together because the joint will harden in seconds. The joint will want to spring apart, so hold it for about 15 seconds to make sure it stays tight.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/working-with-plastic-pipe-08-fully-seated-joint.jpg" alt="" width="669" height="623" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2084" />

<strong>Finished joint should be completely seated so water flows smoothly, without obstruction.</strong>

Don't worry if you make a mistake. Plastic fittings and pipe are inexpensive and you can easily saw out the bad joint. However, you might have to extend a pipe with an extra fitting if positioning is critical.

You can buy solvents, cleaners, primers, and all the other supplies at home centers and full-service hardware stores, but I like to use a plumbing supply store for the best selection of materials and good advice.

<p class="box">PVC also makes a great alternative for building your own <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/small-woodshop-dust-collection/">dust collection system</a> for your small homeshop.</p>

<h2>Joining PB</h2>

Unlike the three types of plastics above, PB (polybutylene) joints are made with special compression fittings (Photo 9).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/working-with-plastic-pipe-09-tighten-special-pb-fittings.jpg" alt="" width="569" height="556" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2085" />

<strong>Tighten special PB fittings with slip-joint pliers or a wrench to make leak-proof joints. Joints must be readily accessible.</strong>

These fittings cost more than CPVC fittings, but since you can bend PB pipe much like a garden hose, you can make longer runs with fewer fittings.

However, plumbing codes require that all compression fittings be readily accessible in case they leak. This can be an inconvenience because you have to leave access panels in walls and ceilings to get to them.

<h2>Other Guidelines And Tips For Working With Plastic Pipe</h2>

<h3>Support</h3>

All pipe must be supported, and plastic requires more support than metal. Support ABS, PVC and PB every 32 in. when it runs horizontally and every 4 ft. when it runs vertically (Photo 10).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/working-with-plastic-pipe-10-support-pipe-with-hangers.jpg" alt="" width="567" height="555" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2086" />

<strong>Support plastic pipe with plastic hangers sized to fit the pipe. Or use flexible plastic or steel banding.</strong>

Support CPVC every 3 ft. Confirm these distances with your local plumbing inspector, because codes vary. Studs and other framing count as support when the pipe runs through them.

<h3>Protection</h3>

Whenever a pipe passes through wood and comes within 1-1/4 in. of its edge, cover that area with a 1/16-in. thick steel plate (Photo 11).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/working-with-plastic-pipe-11-add-protective-steel-plate.jpg" alt="" width="566" height="488" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2087" />

<strong>Add a 1/16-in. protective steel plate whenever the pipe passes within 1-1/4 in. of the surface of wood framing. Drill oversized holes in the framing so the pipes won't squeak when they expand and contract.</strong>

This protects the pipe from misguided nails and screws.

<h3>Pipe Movement</h3>

Cut slightly oversize holes through wood members so plastic pipes can expand and contract easily when hot and cold water run through them. This avoids squeaking or "ticking" when the pipe moves.

<h3>Transitions</h3>

To make a transition from galvanized pipe or copper water lines to plastic, use special plastic transition fittings that have one threaded side (Photo 12). Make sure you buy the right size!

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/working-with-plastic-pipe-12-special-threaded-fittings.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="628" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2088" />

<strong>Buy special threaded fittings to make the transition from plastic to copper and threaded galvanized pipe. Use rubber transitions for larger galvanized and cast iron pipe.</strong>

For transitions to larger galvanized drains or vents, use rubber transition couplings with a steel sleeve (Photo 12). For hubless cast iron, use rubber and steel transition couplings as well.

<h3>Noise</h3>

Plastic doesn't muffle the sound of draining water nearly as well as cast iron or steel pipe. Lessen this annoyance by tucking insulation around plastic drain pipes before you close up the wall or ceiling.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This nifty stool is lightweight, small and easy to carry. It folds flat and it's sturdy. I carry mine in my trunk and use it all the time for camping trips and watching Little League games and parades.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/folding-stool-00-opening-1024x960.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="522" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2093" />

But all practicality aside, this stool is as irresistible as a wooden puzzle. You'll love the way the stool unfolds — the two halves of the seat glide together as the legs slide apart below. In order for the stool to work smoothly, you'll have to be precise when you shape the parts and drill the dowel holes.

And the best way to ensure precision is to use jigs. I used two layout jigs (Fig. A) and two assembly jigs.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/folding-stool-fig-a-exploded-view-785x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="727" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2092" />

The assembly jigs are cut from pieces of scrap plywood or particleboard (see the Cutting List). If you want to make more than one stool, you'll save a lot of time by using the jigs. Figure three hours to build your first one, and about one hour more for each additional stool.

<h2>Lumber And Material Costs</h2>

This stool was made from fir because it's light and strong, but almost any wood will work.

Your wood must be exactly 3/4 in. thick. If not, the stool won't work using the dimensions given in the Cutting List.

All the materials needed to build one stool will cost you about $40.

<h2>Tools Needed</h2>

<ul><li>hammer</li>
<li>nail set</li>
<li>table saw</li>
<li>jigsaw</li>
<li>combination square</li>
<li><a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-drill-driver-kit/">drill</a></li>
<li><a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/best-drill-bit-set/">1/2-in. dia. spade bit</a></li></ul>

A few bar or pipe clamps and a couple of spring clamps will come in handy.

<h2>Making The Assembly Jigs</h2>

Make the jigs for parts B and D from scrap wood as shown in Fig. A.

Mark the jig end hole locations using a combination square as shown in Photo 1, then use a compass to draw the radiused ends and a jigsaw to cut them.

Next, use some scrap 3/4-in. plywood to make the assembly jigs H and J. If you take your time making the jigs, the project will go together easily.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/folding-stool-01-making-the-jigs.jpg" alt="" width="627" height="619" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2094" />

<strong>Locate the center end of a board with a combination square. After cutting the end of the board square, align the 45-degree side of the combination square to one corner as shown and draw a line. Do the same on the other corner and the intersecting lines will be the same distance from each side as well as from the end of the board.</strong>

<h2>Cutting And Drilling</h2>

Cut pieces A through G from the Cutting List but cut pieces B and D about an inch longer than given for now. These pieces are the legs and seat supports that you'll mark for exact length with the layout jigs as shown in Photo 2.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/folding-stool-02-marking-the-holes.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="659" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2095" />

<strong>Use layout jigs whenever you do a project that has a lot of duplicate pieces. These layout and assembly jigs were made from scrap particleboard. For easy alignment, glue short cleats to the sides of the layout jigs. Finish nails make great jig hole markers. To use them, lay out the hole locations and drill holes in the jig the same diameter as the nails. Then to mark the workpiece, slip it under the jig and tap the head of the nail with a hammer.</strong>

Cut the radiused edges of B and D with a jigsaw. Drill 1/2-in. holes for the pivot rods (G) and the handle (F) as shown in Photo 3.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/folding-stool-03-cutting-clean-holes.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="582" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2096" />

<strong>To avoid wood tearout, drill holes from both sides. Drill about halfway or until the point of the spade bit just starts to show on the backside of the piece, then flip the piece over and finish the hole. A 1/2-in. dia. spade bit was used to drill holes. Spade bits are inexpensive, and if kept sharp, drill splinter-free holes. Use a depth stop flag to alert you when it's time to flip the piece over and drill from the other side.</strong>

Also layout and drill small pilot holes for the nails that attach the seat slats (A and E) to the seat supports, and for the nails that attach the leg braces (C) to the legs.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/folding-stool-04-sanding-multiple-curves.jpg" alt="" width="637" height="566" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2097" />

<strong>Group similar parts together to sand the pieces uniformly. Individually sanding each piece is tedious and wastes time. The stool handle was used to temporarily align the parts as they were sanded.</strong>

<h2>Assembling The Stool</h2>

Putting all these parts together may appear a bit confusing, but taken one step at a time, it's really pretty easy. The stool consists of two main assemblies, an outside half and an inside half.

Assemble the outside half first by using the assembly jig (H) as shown in Photo 5. Glue and nail the seat slats (A and E) to the outside seat supports (D).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/folding-stool-05-glue-nail-seat-slats.jpg" alt="" width="622" height="511" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2098" />

<strong>Glue and nail the seat slats (A and E) in place using a 1/2-in. spacer. The spacer and assembly jig help ensure proper spacing.</strong>

Align the outside legs with the assembled seat half, then push pivot rods (G) into the end holes of two legs (B) and into the seat supports. Drill a small pilot hole for the brads through the legs and pivot rods, and hammer in the 1-1/4 in. brads to lock the dowels into the outside legs.

Hold the legs tight to the seat supports (D). Then align, drill a pilot hole, glue and nail the outside leg brace (C) in place (Photo 6).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/folding-stool-06-attach-outside-leg-brace.jpg" alt="" width="589" height="554" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2099" />

<strong>Attach the outside leg brace to the outside legs. Use the assembled seat half to align the legs.</strong>

Now assemble the inside half. Start by sliding the remaining two seat supports onto the ends of the handle (F). Next, push the remaining two legs onto the ends of the handle and nail the legs to the handle while this assembly is lying flat on the workbench.

To get the right width for the inside assembly, clamp the inside legs (B) to the assembly jig (J) as shown in Photo 7.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/folding-stool-07-nail-inside-leg-brace.jpg" alt="" width="630" height="556" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2100" />

<strong>Nail the inside leg brace to the inside legs. Clamp the inside legs to the assembly jig (J) for proper spacing.</strong>

Now, glue and nail the inside leg brace (C) in place. Make sure you have the square ends of the seat supports pointing down when you attach the leg brace (Photo 7).

Before nailing the remaining seat slats on the inside assembly, you'll need to temporarily join the inside and out-side stool halves. Slip the remaining two pivot rods into the middle hole in the legs to align the halves, but don't nail those rods to the legs yet. Now, hold the inside seat supports tight to the inside legs. Glue and nail the remaining seat slats to the inside seat supports (Photo 8).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/folding-stool-08-glue-nail-seat-slats.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="556" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2101" />

<strong>Glue and nail the seat slats to the inside seat supports after joining the stool halves temporarily with the pivot rods (G). Be sure to align the inside seat slats to the edges of the outside seat supports.</strong>

<h2>Finishing Touches</h2>

Test the moving parts by opening and closing the stool a few times. Then push out the pivot rods that join the two stool halves and separate the halves. Use a nail set and hammer to set all the nail-heads slightly below the surface of the wood.

Sand all the exposed sharp edges of the wood with fine sandpaper. Fill the nail holes with putty, and finish the stool with Danish oil. Don't use varnish because it will make the pivoting dowels clog and bind.

After the finish is dry, rejoin the two stool halves and insert the pivot rods. Drill pilot holes and hammer brads through the inside legs and pivot rods only.

		<title>How Do You Convert An Outside Light To A Motion Sensor?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[How often have you come home at night, fumbled for the door key, and wished you'd left the light on? Or had to negotiate an icy sidewalk in the dark? Or felt apprehensive about strange noises outdoors?

A motion detector that automatically switches on the outdoor lights is the perfect convenience to welcome you home at night, usher you up the walk (no need to fear tripping on a baseball bat!), and ease your concern about intruders entering your yard. It switches on the lights exactly when and where you need them. It'll even spot the furry critter that raids your garbage can at night!

In this article, you'll read about how motion detectors work, see the best places to put them, and learn how to make a safe and trouble-free installation.

<h2>How Do Motion Detectors Work?</h2>

Motion detectors are small electronic eyes that detect infrared waves, that is, the heat waves that objects radiate, even at night. When the detector sees an object move across its field of view, especially warmer objects such as people, animals, and cars (see the illustration above), it electronically flips a switch that turns on the lights. The lights remain on anywhere from 1 to 20 minutes, depending on how you preset the timer. Then it automatically shuts the lights off unless the detector continues to sense movement.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/security-lighting-motion-detectors-00-opening-1024x785.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="427" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2111" />

As you can see in the illustration above, a motion detector has tunnel vision. Its field of view is limited to a wedge-shaped area about 100 degrees wide and not much beyond 50 ft. So you have to aim it right at the zone you want to cover.

And since the detector senses the motion of animals as well as people, it'll react to the movement of the family dog standing about 15 ft. away, as readily as to the approach of an adult some 45 ft. away (see illustration). In fact, a detector will sometimes react to wind-blown leaves on a bush or to a passing car.

Nuisance "trips" like these that fool the detector and cause lights to come on when you don't want them can be irritating to both you and your neighbors. In fact, many homeowners won't install a motion detector, believing it to be uncontrollable and too much hassle. However, you can solve most unwanted switching by adjusting the detector's sensitivity and aiming it accurately (as you'll see the demonstration later).

Manufacturers connect motion detectors to lights in a variety of ways, as we illustrate in Fig. B.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/security-lighting-motion-detectors-fig-a-best-locations-1024x701.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="381" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2120" />

<strong>Position detectors and lights to cover approaches to your house, commonly used areas and dark, shadowy pans of your yard. Floodlights are the most versatile and cast the most light.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/security-lighting-motion-detectors-fig-b-styles.jpg" alt="" width="876" height="325" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2121" />

Most often, the detector is connected to a waterproof cover plate along with one or two light bulb sockets (Fig. B, No. 1). You can conveniently replace an existing outdoor light fixture with one of these, as our photo series demonstrates. Yet you can still operate the lights in the normal way; the manufacturer's instructions tell you how to shut off the detector when you don't want it to operate. In addition, motion detectors sense daylight and automatically shut themselves off, so they won't switch on lights when you don't need them.

You can buy motion detector/light units at any hardware store or home center. Prices vary, depending on the number of extra electronic features, the quality of the electronics and the number and types of light fixtures included (Fig. B). Usually, the more expensive ones with longer guarantees will better withstand the rigors of weather.

<h2>Where Are The Best Places To Put Motion Detectors?</h2>

For convenience, position motion detectors to cover the walks leading to your front and back doors and the driveway, so the lights will come on when you come home at night (Fig. B). They'll also light up the walks and front steps for visitors. For further convenience, use them on patios, decks and any potentially hazardous locations such as around stairways and swimming pools.

If improved security is a priority, aim motion detectors to cover all the approaches to your house, including fence gates and patio doors. Also aim them into the darker areas of your yard, areas near dense trees and bushes where intruders might hide. (A friend of mine aims one into his side yard to foil mischievous kids who previously used it as a nighttime pathway.) While good night lighting doesn't guarantee safety, it's one of the best low-cost steps you can take to discourage unwanted intruders.

Ideally, it's best to mount motion detectors 6 to 10 ft. above the ground, and position them so that most movement will occur across the sensitivity zone rather than directly toward the detector. Obviously, you can't always do this if you use existing light locations. One solution is to install a motion detector that you can mount some distance away from the lights themselves (Fig. B, No. 3). The wires that connect the detector to the light are low voltage and not dangerous, so you don't have to enclose them in metal or plastic conduit.

<h2>A Primer About Installing Motion Detectors</h2>

Motion detectors are <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/">easy to install</a>, but each type and brand has a few different details. So read the installation instructions supplied by the manufacturer, and use these step-by-step demonstration photos and expert tips as a general guide.

In most cases, you'll simply replace an existing fixture with the new one, as this demonstration shows. However, if you have to run a new electrical cable and install a switch, the job can get complex. Electrical cable run outdoors must be encased in approved conduit and weatherproof electrical boxes (Fig. C). If you're unfamiliar with conduit or the rules for running new circuits, call in a licensed electrician.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/security-lighting-motion-detectors-fig-c-wiring-surface-mount-box.jpg" alt="" width="689" height="731" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2122" />

<strong>Connect wire to a waterproof surface box from the wall side with plastic-sheathed cable OR from the outside with cable run inside approved conduit.</strong>

Working with old electrical boxes can be tricky too. Sometimes they won't contain an equipment ground wire (bare copper or one with green insulation) or other grounding means such as a metal conduit. The National Electrical Code requires that all exposed metal parts of lights be grounded, so check with your electrical inspector to determine if you have to run a new cable with an equipment ground.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/security-lighting-motion-detectors-01-unscrew-old-fixture.jpg" alt="" width="559" height="539" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2112" />

<strong>Turn off the electrical power at the main panel and unscrew the old fixture.</strong>

In addition, many electrical boxes, such as the shallow one in Photo 2, no longer meet the minimum size required by code.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/security-lighting-motion-detectors-02-test-wires.jpg" alt="" width="542" height="553" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2113" />

<strong>Test the wires to make sure the current is off. Rub one lead of a voltage tester (which can be bought at a hardware store or home center) against the ground wire and rub the other lead against the hot wire (black) first, then the neutral wire (white). If the tester lights up in either case, the power is still on. Shut it off at the main panel before continuing.</strong>

<h2>How Do I Calculate Adequate Electrical Box Size?</h2>

Follow these guidelines for calculating box size:

<ol><li>Add the number of hot and neutral wires coming into the box (two in Photo 4),</li>
<li>one wire for all the ground wires combined (one in Photo 4),</li>
<li>one for all the cable clamps combined (this plastic box has one), and</li>
<li>two wires for any fixture connected to the box (no matter how many lights are on the fixture)/li>
<li>To find the minimum box size, multiply the above sum by the space required for the largest wire, 2.00 cu. in. for the 14-gauge wire in our example (2.25 cu. in. for 12-gauge wire).</li></ol>

This method sometimes overestimates the minimum box size, but it simplifies the calculation.

[table id=46 /]

<ul><li>14-gauge wire requires 2 cu. in. of space per wire.</li>
<li>2 cu. in. /wire X 6 wires = 12 cu. in.</li>
<li>This box volume = 16 cu. in., so it is large enough.</li></ul>

<strong>Insert a replacement electrical box (or surface-mounted waterproof box, Fig. C) if the old box is too small. Plastic boxes have the size in cubic inches stamped on the plastic.</strong>

To install this light, it was necessary to replace the old box with a larger one.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/security-lighting-motion-detectors-04-mount-fixture.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="559" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2115" />

<strong>Mount the fixture according to the manufacturer's directions. Run the wires through the rubber gasket. Then connect the neutral wires (white), hot wires (black), and the ground wires (green or bare copper) with wire connectors.</strong>

<h2>Here are 8 more motion detector installation tips</h2>

<ul><li>The cover of an outdoor electrical box must be waterproof. Seat the rubber gasket carefully, and if you lay it against a rough surface (Photo 5), caulk it as well.</li><ul>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/security-lighting-motion-detectors-05-screw-fixture-in-place.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="542" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2116" />

<strong>Screw the fixture in place, making sure the rubber gasket seals the edges of the box so moisture can't get in. Add silicone caulk if necessary.</strong>

		<title>Fence Post Keeps Popping Up? Here’s How To Stop Frost Heaves</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Back when I lived in the countryside, one of my neighbors pointed to a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/repair-wood-fence/">fence</a> post on the low side of his property that stood 6 in. higher than the other posts. "I drove that post back down three years in a row," he said, "but it still keeps popping up." It wasn't a persistent woodchuck at work. It was the annual work of winter-time frost.

Frost, the same light, delicate stuff that periodically coats your window glass in winter, is a surprisingly powerful natural force. It lifts the soil, cracks rocks and snaps trees, altering the landscape in almost every neighborhood that has freezing weather. Sidewalks crack and pop up like logjams; concrete driveways, front stoops, and steps rhythmically rise, fall or begin to creep away from houses or garages; and decks and patios begin to tilt. <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/build-wood-fence/">Fences</a> lean to the side and retaining walls crack too.

Unfortunately, you won't notice the effects of frost until the damage is done. Frost usually works slowly but steadily, year after year, lifting and shifting a wall or driveway until hairline cracks become gaping chasms. Or you'll suddenly notice that the 1/4-in. gap between the house and porch has grown to a full inch, or the patio door won't open because the concrete slab outside has risen and pushed up the sill.

In this article, you'll learn how frost works, why it's so powerful, and what you can do to limit its damage.

<h2>Why Frost Heave Occur</h2>

The frost that can lift and shift an entire building is no different than what forms on your window, but it's more mysterious because it occurs underground. Fig. A gives you a gopher's eye view of frost in action.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/post-keeps-popping-up-stop-frost-heaves-fig-a-how-frost-heaves-occur.jpg" alt="" width="565" height="903" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2128" />

<strong>Frost pockets called "lenses" can form in the wet ground when it freezes. As a lens thickens, it thrusts the overlying soil or foundation upward. Frost can also latch onto the side of foundations and lift them.</strong>

When the outdoor temperature drops below 32 degrees F, the moisture in the ground begins to freeze, starting at the top. As you know, the upper level of soil gets rock hard, so that you need a pick to chip through the top layer if you have to dig a hole. Frost gradually works its way down as persistently cold weather cools the soil at ever deeper levels. If the soil is well-drained and contains little moisture, frost spreads evenly through the soil and won't cause trouble. But if the soil is wet, the water will often freeze in a paper-thin sheet, called a lens." Imagine a huge, thin contact lens buried underground.

Depending on the weather, these icy lenses can grow thicker, fed by water rising up through the soil from wetter soil below or from the water table. The water table is the level at which groundwater fully saturates the soil. It can begin anywhere from a few feet to more than 100 ft. under your house, depending on the climate and soil conditions in your locale.)

When water freezes, it expands about 9 percent in volume (which is why, of course, ice cubes float in your lemonade rather than clunking to the bottom). So when water freezes against the lens, it expands, thickens the lens and compresses the soil, eventually thrusting the soil upward along with everything on top of it. This uplift is called "frost heave."

Usually, the heave is slow, creeping only a fraction of an inch over days. Yet the power of a frost heave is virtually unstoppable, because the expansive force of freezing water is huge, somewhere around 50,000 lbs. per sq. in. A frost heave can lift a seven-story building or collapse massive, steel-reinforced concrete walls. So foundations, garages, decks, patio slabs and just about everything else around your house won't have much of a chance if a frost heave gets ahold of them.

When temperatures rise and the frost lens melts, the damage is already done. The cracks remain, and foundations, once heaved, never quite settle back to their original place. Each year they move a bit farther astray until you've got major problems.

<h2>Coping With Frost Heaves</h2>

People who live in the Southern Gulf States and on the Pacific Coast, where frost rarely penetrates the soil more than an inch or two, don't need to worry about frost heaves. But the rest of us would live in topsy-turvy neighborhoods if builders didn't design homes to prevent frost heaving in the first place.

Frost heaves commonly occur in two ways. Most often, a frost lens forms beneath a foundation or footing and heaves it upward. But ice crystals can also grab onto the rough or porous surface of a foundation or footing and lift it from the side (Fig. A).

A shifting foundation will quickly ruin a home and cost the homeowner big bucks, so builders don't take chances. When they build a house, they give it a "frost footing" made up of foundation walls or piers that extend below the "frost line" so a frost lens can't form beneath it and lift the house. The frost line is the depth in the ground beyond which frost is not likely to penetrate (Fig. B).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/post-keeps-popping-up-stop-frost-heaves-fig-b-frost-depth-zones-us-canada.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="596" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2129" />

<strong>The map shows approximate frost depths during a colder-than-average winter. The actual depth varies widely due to different soil types, the moisture content of the soil, and the ground cover (bare soil, turf, snow, etc.). The building code in your area specifies a frost line depth that all local building foundations must meet or exceed.</strong>

Your local building inspector will tell you the frost line depth for your area. It ranges from zero in much of California where little or no frost occurs, to 10 in. in parts of Kentucky, to 60 in. in frigid International Falls, MN.

Frost won't usually latch onto the side of a house's foundation because even a small amount of heat from the interior drives moisture in the soil away from the walls. However, frost sometimes grabs onto the foundation of an unheated structure.

Frost can work its mischief on porches, garages and <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/how-to-design-build-raised-deck/">decks</a> too. If these "secondary" structures are connected to a house, building codes require that they have frost footings as well. That's because these connected structures will damage the house if they heave. This may seem like a pain if you're adding a deck or front porch, but porch floors can heave up under doors. and tilting decks can pull house walls outward. The cost of repairing a frost heave's damage can easily exceed the original cost of a porch or deck.

<h2>Floating Structures</h2>

It's usually not economical or necessary to put frost footings under secondary structures, including garages, decks, sidewalks, patios and retaining walls, if they're not connected to the house. With proper precautions, these structures can safely "float" on top of the soil without frost footings.

But a mistake here can cause trouble — just ask my father-in-law. The concrete floor of his garage is steadily turning to rubble as it annually shifts, lifts and cracks (more on this later). You may encounter other common problems, such as concrete patio slabs that lift under door sills and jam the doors, and deck posts that shift and pull a deck away from the house.

To successfully prevent frost damage to floating structures, you have to take a close look at the soil you're building on.

<h2>Frost And The Soil</h2>

Frost heaving doesn't occur automatically whenever the weather turns cold. It requires a certain amount of moisture and a "frost-susceptible" soil. Soils that contain coarse particles of gravel and sand drain well and won't usually heave, because they don't collect and hold enough water to form frost lenses. They're called "non-frost-susceptible" soils. Soils with finer particles like clays and silts, on the other hand, don't drain as well and hold a lot of water. They're called "frost-susceptible" soils.

Of course, most soils are mixtures of sands, clays, and silts, so you're not likely to recognize any one type when you dig a footing hole for your deck. Unless you hit gravel or pure sand, it's usually best to assume that your soil is somewhat frost susceptible.

But don't despair. Even frost-susceptible soil usually won't heave if you provide good drainage (assuming the water table is far enough underground). Good drainage would solve my father-in-law's problem. His garage sits near the house in a slight depression that stays wet longer than other parts of the yard. Unfortunately, there's no easy way to provide drainage now without major digging. Rather than scraping away the topsoil and putting the concrete slab on grade level, the garage builder should have dumped a foot or two of clean sand or gravel on top of the grade to build up the site. (Builders stipulate "clean" because even a 10 percent contamination by silts or clays can change the character of sand or gravel and make it frost susceptible.) This would have provided enough drainage and stability to keep the concrete slab intact.

To prevent frost heaves, the easiest and least costly solution is to plan in advance for good drainage away from walks, patios, garages, decks and other floating structures (Fig. C).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/post-keeps-popping-up-stop-frost-heaves-fig-c-clean-sand-under-concrete-waxed-tubes-612x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="932" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2130" />

<strong>A layer of clean sand or gravel under a concrete slab, combined with good drainage, will eliminate most frost heaves. The more frost-susceptible your soil, the thicker the bed of sand or gravel you'll need. Piers wrapped in plastic, waxed tubes or PVC plastic pipe will resist frost heaving from the side.</strong>

And a bed of sand or gravel underneath improves drainage and decreases frost susceptibility.

Don't hesitate to discuss soil conditions with your local building inspectors. They should be familiar with local conditions and able to warn you of potential trouble.

<h2>A Deck Builder's Problem</h2>

It's not always feasible to provide good drainage in frost-susceptible soil for post footings for decks. Even if you put the footing down to the frost line, frost can still grab the side of the post or footing and push it up. In these cases it's best to surround the post or concrete with a smooth surface of plastic, a waxed tube or plastic pipe (Fig. C) to keep frost from bonding to the sides and jacking up the footing. Refill the hole around the post or tube with the soil you dug out, making sure to tamp it down solidly in 6-in. increments as you fill the hole. Solidly packed soil, mounded at the top, will keep water from saturating the soil around the fooling and causing potential heaves. It's tempting to fill the hole with sand or gravel, thinking you'll provide good drainage that way. However, unless you also provide underground drainage, you'll actually create a catch basin for water around the footing, making the potential for frost heaving even greater.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>First Things First: Why Did I Decide To Write About Drill Bits?</h2>
Have you ever felt frustrated using a cheap tool?

While making a repair at home, have you ever been betrayed by a poor-quality screwdriver?

Have you ever berated at a pair of pliers that gave up on you in the middle of a job?

I have been there. I have had to rely on cheap tools when I was in a pinch and, BY GOD, it was frustrating when any of the above happened. I hate cheap tools. I hate to waste money on them, I hate when they break on my hands, I hate when they destroy the tiny screws that hold my iPhone battery on its place. (All of these have happened to me in the past.)

After spending too many hours suffering with poor quality tools, I decided it was time for a change, and I spent 46 hours reading customer reviews and forum posts by DIYers like me, reading magazines, and also looking at pictures before choosing what I wanted to buy.

<p class="box"><strong>Most Durable Kit: Bosch MS4091</strong>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/56RInAibs9s?rel=0" width="448" height="252" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start"></span></iframe>
What I like the most about Bosch’s kit is the ratcheting screwdriver that comes along with it. The bits in this kit are coated with titanium, a tougher material than the black oxide used in most kits. The assortment here is good, too. Bosch's case is tougher, which means it will be more durable than the average.

So now my rant is over and you will better understand my point of view. Moving on, I will talk about the good stuff.

</ul>
<p class="note"><strong>VERDICT</strong>: This Black &amp; Decker set has no spade bits, no hole saw, and no sockets. The bit materials are not special, meaning they are likely to last less. And they added 34 screws to increase the "parts" count from 75 to 109. It is also <strong>one of the cheapest drill &amp; drive bit sets that I have analyzed</strong>, plus it does have bit size variety. If you intend to use something once in a blue moon and are very short on cash, it could still be useful to you without having to risk buying a no-name brand. Personally I would not spend my money on them, however Amazon has many positive product reviews -- <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009QYLOD8/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">you can check them out here</a>.</p>

<h2>5 Drill Bits Types To Drill Big Holes</h2>

The first big hole I drilled was very expensive. My mission was to install a new deadbolt lock in our front door.

Lacking the needed 2-1/8 in. drill bit, I improvised; I used a pencil and tomato paste can to trace the hole on the door, then drilled a small pilot hole and began cut-ting away with a jigsaw. One hour, four jigsaw blades and one now unusable door later, I concluded a much cheaper hole saw would have been a wise investment.

Boring large holes isn't an everyday occurrence, but when you do encounter the task, it's important to have the right tools and skills.

<h3>Big Boring Basics</h3>

The various big diameter bits have a few guiding principles in common:

<ul><li><strong>Big bits work best with big drills</strong>. For best results, use at least a 1/2-hp (4 to 5 amps) drill with at least a 3/8-in. capacity chuck (one that can grasp bit shanks up to 3/8 in. in diameter). Anything smaller and you'll risk burning out the motor or getting the bit stuck halfway through the hole. Drilling large holes can easily overtax a cordless drill too. A 12-volt cordless tool can handle some jobs, but anything less powerful is iffy.</li>
<li><strong>Drill at a low speed-500 rpm or slower</strong>. Most large, 1/2-in. drills spin in that range anyway, but operate smaller variable speed drills at low speeds.</li>
<li><strong>Never use the constant-on button</strong>. If you lose your grip, the drill will keep spinning until it's wound the cord around itself or you, battering your project along the way.</li>
<li><strong>Never underestimate the power of a big drill and bit</strong>. I've injured myself boring holes through studs when the bit has bogged and the still-revolving drill has flung my hand into the floor or stud. Brace yourself firmly and use extreme care when working from a ladder. Use a drill with a side-handle for the most control.<li>
<li><strong>Brace your work</strong>; the friction of the bit can spin even large boards.</li>
<li>Splintering the backside of the hole is a problem with any bit, but particularly with large ones. <strong>Use a backer board</strong> or drill from both sides.</li>
<li><strong>Wear protective eyewear</strong>.</li></ul>

<h3>Hole Saws</h3>

Hole saws cut only the perimeter of the hole, making them useful only for holes bored all the way through.

There are many versions of the hole saw:

<ul><li>Standard hole saws cut to a depth of about 1-1/4 in.;</li>
<li>Deep cutting versions cut 1-3/4 in. or more — deep enough to bore through a stud in one shot.</li></ul>

Hole saws require a center bit to get them started and keep them on target. Some manufacturers use a pilot bit — simply a twist drill bit that's secured to the hole saw with a set screw. Others use a mandrel or arbor — a twist drill bit attached to a locking nut that secures it to the hole saw. One pilot bit, mandrel or arbor will guide a whole set of compatible hole saws.

When working with hole saws, remember:

<ul><li>The tip of the pilot bit must be set at least 1/8 in. beyond the perimeter cutting teeth.</li>
<li>When using a carbide hole saw to drill through tile, chip the glazed surface with a prick punch to help stabilize the pilot bit.</li>
<li>Stay perpendicular to the surface; cutting at an angle will cause the hole saw to bind and create an oblong hole.</li>
<li>Hole saw cutouts make great wheels for toys and projects. Remove the cutout from the hole saw by punching or prying with a 16d nail through one of the side or top access holes.</li></ul>

<h3>Spade Bits</h3>

Spade bits commonly range in size from 1/4 to 1-1/2 in. and are relatively inexpensive.

They basically shave away wood, meaning you need to push them into the wood for them to cut effectively. Dull bits can be sharpened with a file.

Bits with raised spurs on the outer edge of the spade will minimize — but not eliminate — tear-out when breaking through the far side of a hole.

Spade bits, because of their simple design, are easily modified. If you need a tapered hole, taper the bit's sides with a file or grinder. For a slightly smaller hole, uniformly file down the edges.

<h3>Self-Feeding Boring and Auger Bits</h3>

These self-feeding bits are often used by electricians and plumbers. The center feed screw pulls them into the wood while the inside cutters quickly remove wood. The wood boring-type bits resemble a Forstner bit but have large, aggressive teeth. They range in size from 1 in. to more than 4-1/2 in.

The auger-type bits have a maximum diameter of about 1-1/2 in. The auger design delivers wood chips out of the hole, making these bits ideal for boring deep holes. Long bits allow better access to studs and eliminate a lot of climbing and stooping.

Boring and auger bits stand up well against <em>occasional</em> nails and tough knots. If you have hundreds of holes to drill, they're worth the investment.

<h3>Forstner Bits</h3>

These are the bits of choice for woodworkers and furniture builders. They bore holes with exceptionally smooth walls and flat bottoms (except for the small indentation from the centering spur).

They're guided by the perimeter cutters and are ideal for boring holes that are angled or overlapping.

<h3>Adjustable Bits</h3>

There are many types of expand-able bits. Avoid the super-cheap ones; they break or wobble and cut slowly. The ones I've had best luck with are:

<ul><li><strong>Adjustable hole saws and circle cutters</strong>. Outer cutting spurs are 1/2 to 4 in. from the pilot bit to cut holes 1 to 8 in. in diameter.</li>
<li><strong>Expandable spade bits</strong>. Good ones are expensive, but can drill holes ranging from 7/8 to 3 in. in diameter. When you use these, avoid nails like the plague; one ding and you're faced with an expensive sharpening task.</li></ul>

<h3>Gigantic Holes</h3>

To create big, round holes or discs, make a swing-arm jig. This is basically a huge compass that substitutes a screw for the radius tip and a router for the pencil. For less precise tasks, use a jigsaw on a swing arm.

To create a deep, wide diameter hole (that doesn't have to be pretty) go the low-tech route. Mark the perimeter of your hole, drill a series of 1-in. holes, then finish cutting through with a key-hole saw.

<h2>Why Would You Need A Drilling And Driving Kit?</h2>
You can be in different stages of your life – a homeowner or simply renting an apartment.

The truth is that you will, at some point or another, need to get your hands dirty for the odd job around the house. Perhaps you want to hang a picture on the wall, install door hardware, build a birdhouse, install shelving and organize your garage.

In any case, you will be thankful that you had a complete and durable kit with the right tool for the job at hand. This way you can simply complete your job and saved you a trip to the hardware store.
<h2>What Makes A Good Set?</h2>
<h3>Durability And Quality Materials</h3>
The higher-quality sets must be durable. Drill bits can be made from different materials, and each offers possibilities for different uses. Below you will find the most common materials and what they are good for:
<ul>
 	<li>Steel: good for softwood such as pine, however, they dull quickly in hardwood such as oak.</li>
 	<li>High-Speed Steel (also known as HSS): harder and resist heat better than normal steel ones. As a result, they hold sharpness longer. They are good for boring in wood, PVC, fiberglass, and soft metals such as brass or aluminum.</li>
 	<li>Cobalt: very hard and dissipate heat fast. They can drill soft metals and tough ones such as stainless steel.</li>
 	<li>Black oxide-coated HSS: the coating is a special finishing to increase durability and resist corrosion. They work well on the same materials as their HSS counterparts.</li>
 	<li>Titanium-coated HSS: they are even better and tougher than black oxide ones because they produce less friction, and work well to drill metal, wood, PVC, and fiberglass.</li>
 	<li>Carbide-tipped: the strongest and sharpest ones and work great for drilling masonry and tile.</li>
</ul>
As a rule of thumb, sharper points are designed to work with softer materials – drilling cleaner holes for entry and exit with higher accuracy. Flatter points usually need a pilot hole to avoid them from wandering.
<h3>Variety Of Dimensions And Shapes</h3>
In terms of diameter, a good assortment will bring sizes ranging from 1/16 to 1/4 inch. These can perfectly handle most DIY jobs around your home. Larger diameters from 5/16 to 1/2 inch can be added later since they are seldom used.

You should also pay attention to the shank size. It should not be bigger than your drill chuck, Most power drills are 1/2 inch; a drill press is usually 1/2 or 5/8 inch. All of the sets I analyzed are 1/2 inch, so you most likely will not have an issue with that.

Shanks also come in three shapes:
<ul>
 	<li>Round, which allows you to center the bit in the shank with accuracy.</li>
 	<li>Hex, which has 6 flat surfaces, so your power tool can grip it very tightly and apply greater torque. Hex shanks are usually found in quick-change chucks, the ones commonly found in cordless drills. That means you do not need to loosen and tighten the chuck every time you need to change bits.</li>
 	<li>Slotted drive system, usually referred to as SDS, is specially designed for hammer drills and their forward and backward hammering motion. The drill chuck holds it by the slots and the flat areas of the shank.</li>
</ul>
<p class="box"><strong>Forstner Set: Porter-Cable PC1014</strong>
This set comes with 14 Forstner bits, all properly protected in a good box for longer durability.
Porter-Cable is a traditional brand, that makes a quality toolkit, and sells it at a great price. What else is there to say about it?

<h3>Variety Of Purposes</h3>
Also, you want variety. The best kits offer a good variety of the useful drilling and driving bits. You want your kit to contain:
<ul>
 	<li>Twist bits, also known as all-purpose bits, are the most common ones for home use.</li>
 	<li>Brad point bits, specially created for drilling into wood. The brad at the tip is what creates both accuracy on the entrance hole and a clean exit when exiting the wood. The extra-wide grooves, called flutes, help remove excess material.</li>
 	<li>Masonry bits, good for concrete, brick, and other types of tough masonry, work especially well with a hammer drill.</li>
 	<li>Hole saw bits, with a self-explanatory name, attach to an arbor with a pilot-hole bit and a shank to attach to your drill. They can be very useful for building that birdhouse, or even drilling a hole in your computer desktop so you can improve your cable management and hide the wires below the top. (Please note that I am talking about a hole in your desktop, not in your desktop computer!)</li>
 	<li>Forstner bits, good for cutting precise and big holes just like a hole saw bit, however, the Forstner bit drills cleaner holes.</li>
 	<li>Countersink bit – a cone-ish shape that carves material, so you can install screws flush with the wood and give your project a cleaner look. The best countersink bits also have a pilot hole point, so you can drill a pilot hole and countersink the screw head in only one action. It saves you time and makes your work look even better.</li>
</ul>
<p class="box"><strong>Pilot Hole and Countersink Set: Snappy 40030</strong>
This is an American-made, high-quality set, and it is fully compatible with quick-change chucks (1/4 hex shank). These are very practical and offer great value for your money. What else should you ask for?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Flattening faces and squaring the edges of oversized, warped, rough lumber is a blessing for any woodworker. The truth is simple: the initial investment required to buy a jointer allows you to save money on lumber for years to come.

My guide will compare current offers on the market, so you can take an informed decision about what will work best on your shop.

I chose to compare small benchtop jointers for several reasons: I have a small shop, I like to park my cars inside my garage, and an 8" of even a smaller 6" jointer makes sense for 90% of all woodworking tasks. I also believe a small jointer is an ideal first step for the vast majority of woodworkers. Should you outgrow one of these, you can always sell it on Craigslist and buy a bigger tool later on. Having said that...

<h2>The Best Benchtop Jointers are...</h2>

<p class="box"><strong>Budget Benchtop Jointer: Porter-Cable PC160JT</strong>: If you simply want to get things done, this 6-inch jointer by Porter-Cable is one of the cheapest jointers currently on the market. Since it is also one of the lightest machines as well, it is easy to store it out of your way in your small woodshop. The Porter-Cable is the only benchtop model with variable speed control, which could be useful if you intend to joint exotic lumbers. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q0I8YU/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Click here for info and prices</a>.</p>
<p class="box"><strong>Best Benchtop Jointer: Cutech 40180HC-CT</strong>: I like this 8-inch jointer by Cutech a lot because it offers a spiral cutterhead with 16 double-sided carbide inserts, so your cuts will always have a higher quality and cutter maintenance expenses are way lower on two fronts - carbide needs less sharpenings, plus it makes more sense to change individual inserts versus change an entire knife should you need. The extendable tables also add flexibility to this Cutech jointer, and this is an exclusive feature. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071P997VR/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">See price here</a>.</p>
<p class="box"><strong>Best Benchtop Jointer-Planer Combo: Jet JJP-8BT</strong>: What I like the most about this 8-inch jointer planer combo by Jet is the possibility of haveing two machines within one footprint, which works best for smaller workshops. In my personal circumstances, this Jet jointer-planer is a no-brainer choice for the space savings for my tiny shop. I am much more used to seeing these machines in European Youtuber Woodshops, so I was surprised to see that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001O0D6NS/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Jet sells these machines on Amazon</a>.</p>

[table id=18 responsive=collapse /]

<h2>My History With Jointers</h2>

In my earlier, romantic days of furniture making, I'd hand-plane rough lumber, both faces and edges, in a mad pursuit of an accurately dimensioned board. I spent more time making boards than furniture. Then I bought a jointer.

You don't have to be a fanatical woodworker to need a jointer. The predimensioned lumber, particleboard and plywood you use for projects and home remodeling is going to fit where you put it only if you make it fit.

Along with the table saw, the jointer is the essential wood tailoring tool. It can turn the weekend project maker into a pro with the flip of a switch.

<h2>Why a benchtop jointer?</h2>
This is the ideal size and best choice for small to medium woodworking projects and suit most home workshops.

They already allow you to work with rough lumber and save money instead of being restricted by the S2S (surfaced two sides) dimensions your local home center offers.

<h2>What does a jointer do?</h2>

Contrary to its name, a jointer doesn't make joints; it planes the edges of boards. Don't confuse it with a thickness planer, which dimensions rough lumber to exact thickness, but doesn't do much else.

The jointer is more versatile. It's designed for accurate edge-planing of boards you're gluing together into larger boards such as for cabinets or table-tops, but you'll also use it to:

<ul><li>straighten one edge of a curved board so it follows the table saw fence as you cut it to width;</li>
<li>remove saw marks on the edges of a board cut on the table saw;</li>
<li>flatten warped board faces;</li>
<li>smooth edges of plywood, particle-board and Plexiglas;</li>
<li>micro-plane cabinet door edges to get an exact fit;</li>
<li>bevel door and board edges;</li>
<li>clean up glue joints on laminated boards for lathe turning; and</li>
<li>trim fractions of stock from door or window molding when remodeling.</li></ul>

<How Does A Jointer Work?</h2>

The jointer's cutter head spins between a two-part infeed-outfeed table. The tips of the blades in the cutter head are set level with the stationary outfeed table surface. As the board passes through the blades, its just-planed edge rides across the outfeed table. The infeed table adjusts up and down to determine the depth of cut; the fence positions the board at a preset angle to the jointer table and cutter head. A jointer with its infeed table set at 1/32 in. will remove 1/32 in. all along a flat board edge. The new edge will be the same angle to the board face as the fence is to the jointer bed.

<h2>Tips For Operating A Jointer</h2>

A precision tool is only as precise as its operator. Keep in mind:

<ul><li>The jointer may seem harmless because it runs quietly, but be careful. Never remove the swiveling blade guard.</li>
<li>A row of set screws holds each blade in the cutter head. Check them regularly for tightness with an Allen wrench.</li>
<li>Set the cutting depth at 1/16 in. or less on the inked table before turning on the jointer. If you're planing hardwood, experiment with even shallower cuts to get a smoother board edge and to reduce blade wear and tear. </li>
<li>To joint a board edge, grip the board in both hands and push it toward the cutter head, keeping firm pressure downward on the infeed table and sideways along the fence. Cut with the grain when possible, but the jointer smoothly trims edges when cutting against the grain if you don't rush the cut. Maintain an even feed rate. Don't stop the cut partway through or you'll create "divots" along the cut. When finishing the cut, keep pressure steady on the end of the board to keep it firmly on the outfeed table. </li>
<li>When jointing shorter boards (3 to 4 ft. long) keep your hands in the same position throughout the cut. Longer boards require repositioning your hands to keep pressure consistently downward and against the fence. </li>
<li>Don't joint boards shorter than 12 in. long. Joint longer boards and cut them to length later. </li>
<li>Reposition the fence frequently when jointing boards to distribute wear on the blades. </li>
<li>To straighten a curved edge, joint several inches from one end, then, as you hear the blades losing contact with the cupped edge, lift the board and joint the other end. After a few rotations. the curve will be removed.</li></ul>

<h2>How To Choose A Benchtop Jointer</h2>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-777" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Jointer-Parts.png" alt="" width="1323" height="671" />
<h3>Table Width = Cutting Capacity</h3>
This measurement is the maximum lumber width the jointer can handle.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>6 inches</strong>: this is the smallest jointer you can buy and it fits most budgets. It is best suited for hobby woodworkers and some contractors too, due to its portability.</li>
 	<li><strong>8 inches</strong>: moving up a step in size, 8” jointers give you more flexibility because you can joint wider boards, and in general also allow you to work with longer lumber because they have longer tables and are heavier, more stable machines.</li>
 	<li><strong>16 inches</strong>: these are professional work platforms, suited for large, industrial workshops that need it for daily use.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Table Length</h3>
As a rule of thumb, you can comfortably handle wood that is twice as long as the jointer’s table length. You can buy of make table extensions for occasional work with longer lumber.
<strong>Tip</strong>: Table alignment is one of the two most important things for accurate and dependable results.
<h3>Fence</h3>
Most fences can be set with positive stops at 45°, 90°, and 135°, and also any angle in between. The vast majority of your jointing, though, will happen at 90°.
<strong>Tip</strong>: An accurate fence is the other vital element for ensuring accurate work results, and you ensure it with proper fence control.
<h3>Cutting Depth</h3>
The smaller this figure is, the more passes you will need to make in order to straighten your lumber.

In other words, this is what defines your work efficiency.
<h3>Motor</h3>
Most motors use standard 110v, single phase outlets.

Some jointers, however, allow rewiring to 220v, single-phase.
<h3>Dust Collection</h3>
Do not underestimate the amount of dust and wood shavings your jointer makes during operation.

I strongly believe that keeping a clean shop means keeping a safe shop, so make sure your chosen jointer is compatible with your current dust management system.
<h3>Dimensions and Weight</h3>
Only you can answer these questions based on your own needs and circumstances.
<ul>
 	<li>How much space do you have available in your shop?</li>
 	<li>Can you buy a jointer with a fixed base?</li>
 	<li>Would you rather build your own cabinet and use that as storage space?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cutterhead Type</h3>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Straight Knives</strong>: this is the most common cutter type. The cutters spin on a vertical axis along the jointer width and are usually made of solid steel.</li>
 	<li><strong>Spiral Knives</strong>: this is most advanced in terms of technology. Here the knives spin as they cut into the wood. This design allows for (relatively) more silent operation, as well as less blade sharpening. Wood shavings are smaller too. Some manufacturers offer a spiral design version where they place several inserts – usually 12 inserts for 6-inch benchtop planers to 16 inserts for 8-inch models.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why Helical Cutters are BETTER than Straight Knives?</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>MUCH lower noise levels - think garbage disposal (80 dB) versus lawn mower (90 dB)</li>
 	<li>Carbide cutters stay sharp for a longer time, saving downtime and sharpening costs</li>
 	<li>Possibility to rotate or change just the damaged cutters instead of changing the entire knife</li>
 	<li>Smaller wood chips versus the long wood shavings produced by straight knives (especially soft woods), which clog up dust collection more often</li>
</ul>
<h3>Number of Knives/Inserts and Cuts per Minute</h3>
Simply put, the more knives/inserts a machine has, the more cuts per minute it will make, and the smoother the end result will be.

On the other hand, the higher cuts per minute figures also tend to result in a higher need for re-sharpening the jointer knives.
<h3>Jointer Vs Thickness Planer</h3>
Both machines operate in similar ways to remove material, creating straight and smooth surfaces, however they perform different operations.
<ul>
 	<li>A jointer will first straighten one face and one edge, while also making them square to each other. This is the most important difference to the jointer because it creates the initial references on your stock.</li>
 	<li>A thickness planer is used afterwards to make the opposite face and edge parallel with the previous surfaces, thus finishing to square your lumber. You can also use it for creating uniform thickness in all your lumber before moving on with your project, which is an added convenience.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Ideally you should own both machines</strong>. In real life, they both cost money, which is a finite resource.

If you are in doubt of which purchase you should prioritize, absolutely go for the jointer first because its ability to square stock is much more important than the convenience of having wood planed to a consistent thickness.

Also consider that some manufacturers offer the convenience of combination machines for jointing and planing stock. This is always an interesting choice for smaller shops and tighter budgets.
<h2>Safety Tips For Jointing Stock</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Always use the guard. No excuses allowed here.</li>
 	<li>Jointing stock with knots or other defects increases your chances of accidents.</li>
 	<li>Keep your fingers away from the revolving cutter head.</li>
 	<li>Always joint with the grain.</li>
 	<li>Don't attempt to surface pieces shorter that 12 inches.</li>
 	<li>The maximum depth of cut should be 1/8 inch.</li>
 	<li>Always use a push block when surface jointing or jointing a thin piece of stock.</li>
 	<li>Always stand to the left of the machine and behind the cutter head.</li>
 	<li>Make sure stock is always held firmly against the fence.</li>
 	<li>Check the machine to ensure all parts are securely tightened.</li>
 	<li>Wear safety glasses and hearing protection.</li>
 	<li>Don't wear loose clothing. Roll up long sleeves and keep shirt tails tucked in.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Checking Your Jointer Results</h2>

Place two boards you've jointed edge-to-edge. When a jointer works right, it cuts straight, 90-degree edges that match perfectly with other jointed boards.

If it's not working right, there will be gaps. Two adjustments might be necessary:

<ul><li>Set the fence to 90 degrees with a small square, being sure to check the fence all along its face.</li>
<li>Hold a straightedge firmly on the out-feed table to make sure the tables are parallel. If not, the outfeed table needs adjustment. Many jointers have "gibs" (adjustment screws) at the base of the outfeed table for leveling purposes. After adjusting, recheck the beds with the straightedge.</li></ul>

Don't fret if the jointer's beds go slightly out of level with use. Simply take the time to check and adjust them. Don't leave heavy boards or tools lying on the tables because it'll encourage their misalignment

<h2>Benchtop Jointer Reviews</h2>
Below you will find photos and product reviews for all benchtop jointer models currently available for sale.
<h3>Badge Engineering</h3>
Although there are 13 models reviewed in this page, I am actually comparing only 7 different models.

It's because some of them, made by different companies, are the same machines with different colors. I will also show them below in detail.
<h3>Cutech 40160H-CT, Cutech 40160HC-CT, Porter-Cable PC160JT, and Rikon 20-600H</h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-882 size-full" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/cutech-porter-cable-rikon-same-machine-01.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="222" />

That's right, the 2 Cutech's, the Porter-Cable, and the Rikon are the same machine, with small differences between them.

Both Cutech's feature spiral cutterheads, the only difference between the both of them are the cutterhead insert materials – HSS inserts on the 40160H-CT, and carbide on the 40160HC-CT. Carbide costs more and lasts longer. The Rikon also uses HSS inserts; the Porter-Cable uses straight knives.

The helical cutterhead allows for a smoother, more silent operation and simpler maintenance with reduced ongoing costs. The cutterhead inserts are two-sided, meaning you get 2x as much use out of each one of them. You can replace them individually as you need, which is smart. Replacements can be bought in packs of 10; their price is within reason.

The Porter-Cable specifically is a favorite among hobby woodworkers. The main difference from the rest of the market is its speed control feature for the lumber you are cutting, resulting in smoother surfaces and less wasted time on sanding afterwards. Neither the Rikon nor the Cutech have this feature.

Weighing 40 lbs, this unit is one of the lightest units reviewed today. It’s lightweight enough for being placed in different parts of your small shop as you see fit. In other words, storing it once you have finished using it is easier on your back.

Cutech's customer service is top notch. I have engaged on an online chat at their official website because I wanted to know some measurements as I was writing this guide, and they answered all my questions on the spot. They also sent me an email later informing me of one measurement they didn’t have immediately available with them – the 6-ft cord length. Try that level of customer care with a big name tool brand!

The main problem with this machine is that you will need to spend extra time on your initial table setup. The fence isn’t also super sturdy.

If you are patient when you first get the machine and can live with the fence, you might end up a happy customer.

The spiral cutterhead and the lower price point makes this Cutech benchtop jointer unit one of the best cost-benefit ratios you can find today - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011QMJBG4/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">see it for yourself</a>.

This machine has a lower price point and it does show in the Aluminum fence, which is not the end of the world by itself. The main issue is its fence adjustment system, which needs re-squaring every time you adjust it. It’s a design issue and there isn’t much to be done about it.

The 4-inch dust port is bigger on this unit, compared with 2-1/2 inches in most other benchtop jointers.
<p class="alert">Out of all 4, the Porter-Cable PC160JT is the one I find best. It is the cheapest benchtop jointer on this group, and also one of the lowest prices available on the market today. Do not be discouraged by its flaws. It can very well be your entry into working with rough lumber and saving money on each lumber purchase. Both advanced and beginner woodworkers will get excellent value for their money with its variable speed feature. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q0I8YU/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Click here for info and prices</a></p>

<h3>Cutech 40180H-CT and Cutech 40180HC-CT</h3>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Cutech-40180H-CT-banner.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="222" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-891" />

If you liked the 40160, you probably should consider the 40180 series.

They also have two identical machines, with the only difference between them being the carbide inserts on the 40180HC-CT (versus the HSS inserts on the 40180H-CT).

The main difference between the 40160 series and the 40180 is the width: 8 inches here versus 6 inches on the other machine. These machines also have 16 inserts on their cutterheads versus the 12 on the other machine.

Another important difference is the table length: the 40180 offers 33-1/2 inches, extendable to 51 inches of total length, versus 30 inches on the 40160. By the way, the extendable table is an exclusive feature of this Cutech model.

Everything else is similar in these two machines, so it is really up to you. The 40180 allows you to joint longer and wider stock, so your shop time tends to be more productive.

Do you need the extra capacity offered by the 40180?

Would you like to “future-proof” your purchase and already go for a higher capacity unit?
<p class="box">In my opinion, this is the best benchtop jointer in the market today - the main factors for me are the helical cutterhead, the extendable table, and the double-sided carbide inserts. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071P997VR/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Click here to see today's price</a>.</p>

<h3>Delta 37-071</h3>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Delta-37-071_banner.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="222" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895" />

This Delta benchtop jointer certainly offers you stability. At 76 lbs, this is one of the heaviest machines reviewed here today, so it’s unlikely this unit will move around while you are jointing board on it. The weight also helps reduce machine vibration.

Part of the weight is due to its cast iron construction, much more solid, stable, and durable than the aluminum that you often see in this category.

As with most benchtop models, this jointer uses straight knives. It’s not a deal breaker because the lower price reflects that, however you need to be aware that finishing your boards will likely take longer, since straight knives mark the lumber a bit more than spiral cutterheads.

Swapping the knives is simple due to its jackscrew arrangement.

The fence needs some time to be setup. Once you get it there, though, it is very stable and precise.

The built-in dust blower takes care of most wood shavings, however you will be better off by hooking it up to your dust collection system to avoid clogging the dust chute.

The Delta 37-071 jointer is a great choice for the hobby woodworker who wants a substantial machine for a reasonable price. The cast iron construction benefits certainly make a good cause for this unit.
<h3>Grizzly G0725, Powertec BJ600, and Shop Fox W1829</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/grizzly-powertec-shop-fox-are-the-same-01.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="222" />

I will review these 3 units together because they are exactly the same machine.

This Grizzly/Powertec/Shop Fox jointer has many similar features to the above Delta 37-071, namely cast iron construction resulting in bulky weight, less machine vibration, more solidity, stability, and durability. This machine will not move while you are jointing lumber! They could be a good entrance model if you do woodworking as a hobby.

Here are the two main differences between these three machines:
<ol>
 	<li>It also uses straight knives, however Grizzly/Shop Fox’s knives are made with harder HSS. In other words, Grizzly/Shop Fox’s knives will last you longer and require less re-sharpening or blade changes in comparison with the Delta (or even the Powertec).</li>
 	<li>The Grizzly and the Powertec offer a dust collection bag (and the Shop Fox does not) to capture wood shavings, which could be convenient is you don’t have a dust collection system in your shop.</li>
</ol>
With so many similar characteristics, and some even better such as the knives, you’d be surprised to know that the Grizzly/Powertec/Shop Fox are also much cheaper than the Delta. But there’s a catch.

Adjusting the infeed and the outfeed tables in the Grizzly/Powertec/Shop Fox demands some tinkering, which is not described in the user’s manual. You will also need a pair of 6-inch Allen wrenches in 3 and 5 mm, which are not shipped with this machine. The screws are easy to find under the machine, so accessibility isn’t an issue.

Oddly, not all machines have these issues, so it looks like a quality control issue more than anything. Take that as you will.

If you are patient enough to sort these issues with the Grizzly/Powertec/Shop Fox, you can count on having a dependable workhorse in your home woodshop for a fraction of the price of the Delta.
<h3>Jet JJP-8BT</h3>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Jet-JJP-8BT-banner.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="222" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-892" />

This Jet model is the only benchtop jointer planer combo that I am reviewing today. In other words, buying this machine gives you double functionality for a similar price point of all the other machines available in the market.

If you watch YouTube videos from European makers, you will probably have seen similar machines in their tighter woodshops. Most of these machines have similar designs, where some simple dust port adjustments allow you to switch between jointer and planer in under a minute.
<p class="box"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-889" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Jet-JJP-8BT-black.jpg" alt="" width="769" height="358" />
This is a basic machine. Its main differential from other competitors is having all the functionality you need for jointing and planning lumber to your needs using half as much space. It is one of the best choices for small workshops with tighter budgets because it allows you to be fully functional from day one. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001O0D6NS/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">See today's Amazon price</a>.</p>

<h3>Wen 6560</h3>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Wen-6560-banner.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="222" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-893" />

This Wen is an honest hobby benchtop jointer, plus it is one of the cheapest benchtop jointers currently available at Amazon. As per user reviews, the fence adjustment is the main negative side of this unit.

My main issue with the Wen is that it's just so... average. While it is one of the cheapest currently for sale, and all its specs are on par with the competition, I have a hard time recommending this model to anyone.

Get a Porter-Cable with variable speed control or a Powertec with a dust bag, they cost around the same but offer something extra for your money.
<h3>Woodtek 115955</h3>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Woodtek-115955-banner.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="222" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-894" />

This is yet another lightweight choice if you need a jobsite jointer or simply need to store it out of your way in your small home shop.

The complete lack of customer reviews at Amazon, however, does not inspire me to recommend this jointer to anybody – unless you wouldn’t mind being the first one and taking a chance with your hard-earned money.

The truth is simple - there are very similar machines on the market with similar prices, such as the Grizzly.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A clean shop is a safer and more efficient work environment, as well as a healthier place for your lungs. Smaller woodworking shops deal with the additional challenge of limited space. So how can you ensure you can have an efficient dust collection system without braking the bank?

<strong>While some vendors and magazines may push you to build a central dust collection system, the truth is that this is a must-have only for bigger shops. A good setup can be affordable and keep a clean shop even if your working space is as big as a 2-car garage. First you need to capture most os the dust at the source by mixing the right type of stationary dust collector and portable shop vac, along with simple accessories such as a good cyclone separators and tool-triggered switches. Then you will need a good air filter for the majority of the tiny particles that still get airborne. And, last, you will need good PPE such as a dust mask or a respirator if you grow a beard. If you want the finer details on each item, keep on reading below.</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sander-banner.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="222" />
<h2>Dust Collection at the Source</h2>
The heart of any effective dust collection system is to capture as much dust possible at its source, and then not reintroduce it later in your shop - by filtering it and keeping it inside a sealed container. Capturing the bulk of the dust you produce right at the source means you leave less of it airborne. Airborne dust always ends on top of a project, inside your lungs, or simply on top of your tools. A dirty shop makes you waste precious time, which is equally important whether you do woodworking in your (little) spare time as a hobby or if you do it professionally and need to be productive at all times.

Most woodshops cannot afford neither the space nor the money needed for a central dust collection, or even a bigger stationary dust collector. However, that is no excuse for not having a clean shop. You can buy a quality shop vacuum and accessorize it to make a great ally on capturing dust from all your tools. The trick is to keep an open mind and connect it to one tool at a time.

If you plan on connecting your shop vac to a planer of a router table, it is essential to have a chip separator. These machines produce a lot of larger wood shavings and chips, which can fill up a shop vac very fast. A shop-vac with a 2-1/2 inch hose can handle almost anything you throw at it: larger wood chips and shavings, stationary and benchtop machines, and general shop cleanup. This hose dimension also reduces clogs in general.

The chip separator is very important because it trips heavier dust and wood shavings and chips in a separate container, so only the finer dust arrives to the shop vac itself. This way you can empty this separate container as you need, without overloading the shop vac filter/vacuum bag, saving you money and ensuring maximum air flow.

Another important accessory that is worth its weight in gold is a tool-triggered switch, which will turn on your vacuum at the moment you trigger the tool, and turn off the vacuum a few seconds after you turn off the tool, which will clear the hose/piping of the sawdust and chips.

Coarse sawdust, such as from a table saw or a track saw, is better captured by a smaller-diameter hose. Straight piping also works better than corrugated hose, since the sawdust is less likely to plug up on the inside, however short runs of corrugated hose offer much more flexibility in a small shop, especially when dealing with mobile tools.

Finer dust from sanding moves easily and does not require a powerful shop vac - a 1-1/4-inch hose is already enough. Shop vacs with such hoses cost less and are more compact too, an important factor for smaller shops.

I also recommend you to get a cyclone separator for gathering the bulk of the fine dust before it reaches your shop vac filter. This way you will ensure maximum airflow, which is a more important feature to collect dust than "vacuum" itself.

Finally, you should change your factory filter and get a HEPA filter replacement. They have a smaller mesh to filter the finer dust - the ones that end up clogging up your lungs. By reducing the amount of airborne dust, you place less stress on your shop air cleaner and your dust mask, which makes them last longer and save you money too. You can find HEPA filter replacements in your vacuum manufacturer website.
<h2>(Trash Can Lid) Chip Separator &lt; Thien Baffle &lt; Pentz Cyclone</h2>
These are three different methods to separate the bulk of the wood shavings, chips, and dust before these reach your shop vac and clog it up. If you don't use at least one of them, then you will constantly have to deal with a full shop vac, expensive replacement bags, and reduced air suction.

The first method is the chip separator, which is that weird trash can lid. As I mentioned in the item above, it is useful for machines that produce a lot of bigger chips and shavings, such as a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/benchtop-jointer/">jointer</a>, a planer or a router table. It is a must in any wood shop that has any of thee machines.

One of these other two methods should be used in tandem with the chip deparator for efficient dust collection. There are many online discussions about this, and the super short cliffnotes version of the entire debate is that a Pentz Cyclone is marginally better than a Thien Separator. I will talk about them both and you will be able to draw your own conclusions.

The Thien Baffle was invented by J. Phil Thien. He has a small shop and he developed over 50 iterations of his design, where he uses a baffle in addition to the usual chip separation design. His design is simple and saves a lot of vertical space in comparison to a cyclone.

As for the Pentz Cyclone, this was invented by a man named Bill Pentz. He had a conventional, tiny, store-bought cyclone and ended up in the hospital with allergic reactions and a pneumonia. His shop looked clean, however it had tons of airborne micro dust in the air, which ended up intoxicating him. Being a specialist in air filtration in his day job, Pentz came out of his retirement and developed his own cyclone. It is the best cyclone available in the market... And you need at least 32 by 48 inches of floor space in your shop. Not to mention its 96-inch height. While this is the most effective solution available, it demands a lot of space too. While you can buy other smaller cyclones, most of them lack filtering, airflow, and offer poorer dust separation.

Personally I chose the Thien Baffle design, which I can DIY to fit my personal needs and the space I have available in my shop. While Bill Pentz has made his design freely available in his website, his design demands more space, more volume, and a 3.5 HP motor to power the entire system. That is overkill for my amount of woodworking, and certainly forbidden in my tiny shop.
<h2>Dust Ports are just as important</h2>
A quality dust port adapter will stimulate you to always use your dust/collection system. The multitude of dust port sizes and shapes, especially for the smaller tools and the lack of hose diameter standards means each dust-collection port has its own, unique dimension.

Whether you buy something or make your own port adapters, make sure you have a very simple way to use your dust-collection and it will become a no-brainer to unplug the previous machine and plug the next one into your dust collection system. This is the most efficient way you can ensure your shop always stays as clean as possible, without even cleaning it in the first place.
<h2>Air Cleaner</h2>
A good ambient air cleaner ensures that airborne dust gets trapped in its filters, instead of landing on workpieces, power tools, or even intoxicating your lungs. Ideally you want to hang one of these units in a way that creates a circular motion, where the air flows throughout your entire shop. If you also place it near the tools that make the most unfiltered amounts of dust, you ensure better performance and less dust circulating in the air.
<h2>Dust Masks and Respirators</h2>
Even the best of the dust collection systems will not capture 100% of the dust, therefore Personal Protection Equipment is essential. The best masks have separate inhale and exhale valves, and here's why. Exhaling always releases moisture, which contaminates the filter and makes the mask drop its effectiveness much faster. This will also help avoid that annoying fog in your safety glasses. Also, avoid disposable masks - these do not seal properly around your mouth and nose. You should prefer masks with a rubberized face gasket. Folks with beards should consider a helmet respirator, which blow filtered air inside a visor and is powered by batteries.
<p class="alert">And remember: if all else fails, you can always use a broom to catch that dust in the morning after!</p>

<h2>DIY Solutions for Dust Collecting</h2>

<h3>Dust Collector Adapter</h3>

Shops make dust — on your clothes, on your carpets, and in your lungs. It's not just a nuisance either, it's a health hazard. That's why I recommend that every woodworker set up some system to control it.

Here's a tip on how to rig up an ordinary shop vacuum to just about any dust-generating machine. It uses common home-center materials, and it's a cinch to attach the hose — it just slips in. And in my shop, convenience means I'll actually use it.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dust-collector-adapter.jpg" alt="" width="606" height="621" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2365" />

The key is a plastic pipe adapter designed to fit a metal sink drain, which is the same diameter (1-1/4 in.) as most shop vacuum pipes. It has a plastic gasket and a threaded nut that make a good connection to the vacuum pipe. You can then attach any combination of plastic pipe fittings that works on your machine.

<h3>Precision Dust Control</h3>

Cut down on sanding dust with this tip.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/precision-dust-control.jpg" alt="" width="732" height="489" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2366" />

Screw a radiator hose clamp to a 1x3 board, and clamp the board to your workbench. Insert your shop vacuum nozzle, and you have an "extra hand" to hold the vacuum precisely where you're kicking up dust!

<h3>Sanding Vacuum Box</h3>

With all the electric sanders used in our shops—vibrating, belt and random orbital—we're making an enormous dust storm.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sanding-vacuum-box.jpg" alt="" width="657" height="492" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2367" />

I nailed together this vacuum box to give my lungs and eyes a break! Make the top and bottom from two pieces of 1/4-in. plywood (12 x 18 in.) and the sides and ends from 3/4-in. x 3-in. pine or scrap wood.

Drill a grid of holes in the top with a 5/16-in. bit. In the center of one side, make a port for your vacuum nozzle. A PVC expansion adapter works well, or cut a hole that accepts your nozzle in a tight pressure fit. Hook up the vacuum and you're ready for healthier sanding.

<h3>Dust-Free Sanding</h3>
No need to get dust all over your shop or work area when you're using a finishing sander. Put the whole business — sander, the piece you're sanding, and one hand — in a large, clear plastic bag. Tape the bag around your arm, or use a rubber band.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You may not need one often, but when it comes time to carve out a recess for a hinge or strike plate, nothing beats a razor-sharp chisel. I'll show you basic chiseling techniques and sharpening tips so you'll be ready for any chiseling task.

I learned what chisels shouldn’t be used for long before I learned what they should be used for. My father informed me, during one memorable tirade, that chisels (especially his) were not to be used as screwdrivers, paint can openers, or stakes for my camping tent.

Well then, what is the purpose of these simple little tools? Are they only for the hands of the <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/new-hobby-woodworking/">skilled cabinet maker and woodcarver</a>? Or do they have some honest, down-to-earth uses for honest, down-to-earth DIYers?

Surely, Chisels have lost a lot of ground to power tools: Routers now cut dovetails where Chisels once carved, and belt sanders can fine-tune a curve faster than most of us can wield a chisel. Yet, for making a hinge recess, squaring up a corner or working in places where a power tool might be too big and awkward, there’s still no equal to the good old-fashioned chisel.

<h2>Basic Chiseling Techniques</h2>

After that, it's just a matter of choosing the right technique or combination of techniques to finish the job. Start recesses or mortises by outlining the area with a sharp utility knife or by making a series of shallow chisel cuts perpendicular to the surface. Skip this step and you risk chipping wood outside the mortise. Then remove thin slices by tapping the chisel with a hammer, bevel side down as in Photo 1, to carve out the wood inside the perimeter.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-chisel-basics-01-mortise-cut-564x257.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="257" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2247" />

<strong>Face the bevel down. Push or tap the back of the chisel to remove thin slices. Control the depth by raising and lowering the handle.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-chisel-basics-01-oops-550x564.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="564" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2248" />

<strong>Chiseling with the grain can sometimes have disastrous results. If the grain runs deeper into the wood, it'll direct the chisel too deep. Stop and chisel from the opposite direction if you feel this happening.</strong>

If the recess is open on one side, like a hinge mortise, flatten the bottom by paring off thin slices with the back, unbeveled side of the chisel held flat to the wood (Photo 2).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-chisel-basics-02-paring-cut-564x488.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="488" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2249" />

<strong>Pare thin slices of wood to flatten the bottom of an open recess. Keep the back of the chisel flat on the wood. For easier slicing, pivot the chisel as you cut to move the blade in an arc.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-chisel-basics-03-chopping-cut-564x489.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="489" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2250" />

<strong>Chop out large amounts of wood by slicing off small amounts with each cut. Strike the chisel with a hammer and chop down about 1/2 in. Then chisel from the end to remove the piece before continuing. Your chisel must be sharp for this cut.</strong>

In general, when you're shaving into a piece of wood, face the bevel down (Photo 1). When you're flattening a cut and have access from the side, face the bevel up and hold the back of the chisel tight to the surface (Photos 2 and 5). Chisel out large chunks of wood a little at a time with a series of shallow cuts rather than driving the chisel too deep (Photo 4). Use a hammer or mallet for rough work or press with the heel of your hand for lighter cutting chores or finer cuts.

<strong>Cut a groove, or dado, by first sawing along both edges to the desired depth. Then break out the wood in the middle with your chisel. Space the chisel cuts about 1/2 in. apart.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wood-chisel-basics-04-chop-05-pare-564x201.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="201" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2251" />

<strong>Smooth and flatten the bottom of the dado. Keep the back of the chisel flat to the bottom of the groove. Work from both ends into the center to avoid splintering the edge.</strong>

<strong>Scrape glue joints or other imperfections from wood projects by holding the blade at a right angle to the wood with the back of the chisel facing you. To remove thin shavings, support the blade with your fingers and press down while you draw the chisel toward you.</strong>

<h2>Basic tips on using a chisel</h2>

<ol>
 	<li>Make a series of vertical plunge cuts that are as deep as the hinge is thick. Outline the shape of the recess with plunge cuts first.</li>
 	<li>Remove the small wood chips, cutting at a low angle. Keep bevel side down and raise and lower the handle to control the depth of cut.</li>
 	<li>Pare the surface smooth using the chisel bevel side up. Hold the chisel flat and use a circular or angular motion to prevent tearing.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1175" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/chisels-1-2-3-1024x322.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="175" />
<ol start="4">
 	<li>Chisel with the grain. The blade will have a tendency to follow the grain and dig too deep when worked against the grain.</li>
 	<li>Sharpen your chisel. with a belt sander and fine grit paper. Make certain belt is moving away from, rather than into, the chisel.</li>
 	<li>Use a beater chisel. for rough work. Relegate your badly nicked chisels to these chores so your good ones stay sharp.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1176" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/chisels-4-5-6-1024x332.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="181" />

<h2>Choosing a chisel</h2>

Start with a new sharp 3/4-in. chisel for all-purpose use. (Keep your old dull chisel handy for jobs like cutting nails or scraping caulk.) Buy one with an impact-resistant plastic handle. You can pound on these with a hammer without dam-aging them. If you have a little extra cash to buy good-quality chisels, buy three – 1/2-in., 3/4-in. and 1-in. — for a good starter set.

A good all-purpose chisel for the DIYer is the type with an impact-resistant plastic handle, capped with a metal button. These can be driven either by hand or with a hammer, they’re compact enough to fit in a tool pouch, and they don’t cost much. Chisels with wood handles are available, too, but should be struck only with a wooden mallet or pushed by hand.

Chisels must be made of steel that’s hard enough so they won’t dull easily during use, yet soft enough so they can be easily sharpened when dull or nicked. Good ones find a balance between these two extremes. Avoid El Cheapo models. The blades dull quickly and the handles shatter easily.

Always keep a nicked-up old “beater” chisel in the toolbox next to your sharp ones (Photo 6). The beater comes in handy for removing moldings, packing insulation into skinny crevices, scraping old caulk out of joints, and demolition work. In my everyday puttering, I probably use my beater chisel as much as I do the sharp one.

Even new chisels need sharpening. Polish the machine marks from the first 1 in. of the back of the chisel and hone a bevel on the face. Put your chisels in a sock or a special canvas roll between uses to protect the cutting edge.

<h2>What chisels do best</h2>

Chisels excel at three tasks: making sharp plunge cuts, removing stock and smoothing. All three techniques — shown in these photos — are used to cut the recess for a door hinge.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1174" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/chisels.jpg" alt="" width="741" height="646" />

Plunge cuts are made with the blade’s beveled edge facing the waste side of the cut. These cuts are used first to outline the hinge shape, then to score the area to a consistent depth (Photo 1) so wood can be removed in small manageable chips rather than one large chunk.

Remove the chips with the bevel side down (Photo 2). so you can control the depth of cut by slightly lowering and raising the handle as you work.

Smooth the area with the chisel bevel facing up (Photo 3). Use angled or circular motions to prevent tearing the grain.

<h2>Safety, safety, safety tips</h2>

A sharp chisel gives you great control and allows you to remove paper-thin slices of wood, but it can be dangerous if you're not careful.

<ul>
 	<li><strong>Think safety</strong>. Wear <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/eye-protection/">safety glasses</a> when striking with a hammer. Never push or drive a chisel toward you. Keep them out of the reach of children.</li>
 	<li><strong>Chisel with the grain</strong> (Photo 4). You'll have better control and there’s less chance of taking too deep a chunk.</li>
 	<li><strong>Always use two hands</strong>: one to guide the chisel, the other to push the chisel or to swing a hammer or mallet.</li>
<li>Never chisel toward your body or place your hand in the path of a chisel.</li>
<li>Cover the chisel blade when it's not in use.</li>
<li>Store chisels in a safe place, away from children.</li>
 	<li><strong>Keep your project firmly clamped to the workbench<strong>. When working on large objects, such as doors, place them on a solid surface.</strong></strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Make several shallow passes</strong> rather than one huge bite.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips for sharpening chisels</h2>

A dull chisel is a dangerous chisel — it will lunge and skip. It’s difficult to control and requires more effort to use. Sharp Chisels go where you guide them and leave a smoother surface.

Sharpening is a two-step process. <strong>Shaping</strong>, with a file or grinding wheel, forms the correct tip angle. This needs to be done only when the tool has been badly nicked or damaged. <strong>Honing</strong>, on a sharpening stone, forms the razor-sharp cutting edge.

Here is an overview to the sharpening process:

<ol><li><strong>Shaping</strong>: Old chisels with nicked or rounded tips will need to be <strong>reshaped</strong>. Use a belt sander or grinder to remove nicks and shape the chisel to a 25-degree angle. If you're using a grinder, dip the chisel in water every two or three seconds to prevent the tip from overheating and turning blue. If this happens, the chisel won't hold an edge for long.</li>
<li><strong>Polishing</strong>: Next, polish the back of the chisel by rubbing it back and forth over progressively finer wet/dry sandpaper, pressing the back perfectly flat to the paper. For all sharpening, a good progression of paper is 120, 220, 400 and 600 grit.</li>
<li><strong>Honing</strong>: Finally, set the honing guide to hold the chisel at a 30-degree angle to create a "secondary bevel" and run through the grits, starting at 220. Roll the chisel back and forth over the sandpaper until a burr forms on the back of the blade. Turn the chisel over and stroke it flat on the sandpaper to remove the burr. Then move to a finer-grit paper and repeat the process.</li></ol>

Also, keep these sharpening tips in mind:

<ul>
 	<li>Chisels cut best with a 25- to 30-degree blade bevel. One rough rule of thumb says the bevel face should be about twice as long as the chisel blade is thick.</li>
 	<li>Remove major nicks (tsk, tsk — where was that beater chisel?) by first pushing the tool straight into a grinding wheel to resquare the tip, then sharpening to the proper angle.</li>
 	<li>Hone the edge razor sharp on a sharpening stone. Hold the tip at a constant angle as you sharpen in a circular or figure-eight motion, Remove the burr that forms on the back of the blade tip by stroking that side flat against the stone.</li>
 	<li>You can also use a belt sander (Photo 5) to quickly shape and sharpen chisels. Use a fine-grit paper, hold tight and work in three-second spurts to avoid overheating.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Sharpen your chisels on wet/dry sandpaper that's lightly glued with spray adhesive to a piece of 1/4-in. glass with smoothed edges. Use a honing guide to maintain the correct angle and speed up the sharpening process.</strong>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Curves, cutouts, and straightaways - jigsaws can cut 'em all, providing you use the right blades and techniques.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1279" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/how-to-use-a-jigsaw-1.jpg" alt="" width="462" height="381" />

A woodworker buddy of mine mused that if he could keep only one power saw in his workshop. he'd hold only his jigsaw. Hand-held jigsaws not only excel at cutting curves. but can cut holes, compound angles, and straight lines (with a guide) to boot. They can cut through wood, metal, plastic, and tile, and can handle intricate trim work (Photo 3) or coarse remodeling work.

Sure, jigsaws cut slowly, but that's a bonus when it comes to safety and cleanup, and it makes them great for kid builders and DIYers who shy away from <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-circular-saw/">circular saws</a> or table saws.

For a small tool. it packs a wallop – and the longer I own mine, the more uses I discover for it. Here's what I've found out:
<ol>
 	<li>Make a series of relief cuts in order to more easily negotiate sharp inside and outside curves and turns.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1280" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/how-to-use-a-jigsaw-2.jpg" alt="" width="424" height="316" />
<ol start="2">
 	<li>Make plunge cuts by slowly and firmly lowering the blade into the workpiece while the jigsaw is running. The front of the shoe acts as the hinge point.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1281" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/how-to-use-a-jigsaw-3.jpg" alt="" width="437" height="300" />
<ol start="3">
 	<li>Cope moldings to fit with a jigsaw equipped with a thin, fine-tooth blade. Clamp or firmly hold moldings and make relief cuts as needed.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1282" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/how-to-use-a-jigsaw-4.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="256" />
<ol start="4">
 	<li>Cut perfect circles with a circular guide. Center point digs into work surface. Jigsaw can be secured along guide bar to create different radiuses.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1283" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/how-to-use-a-jigsaw-5.jpg" alt="" width="381" height="305" />
<ol start="5">
 	<li>Use carbide-grit blades for cutting curves and inside corners in ceramic tile. Other specialty blades cut metal, laminates, plastics, and fiberglass.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1284" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/how-to-use-a-jigsaw-6.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="320" />
<ol start="6">
 	<li>Use heavy-duty blades, which are specially designed for cutting through nail-embedded wood, for remodeling, and demolition work.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1285" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/how-to-use-a-jigsaw-7.jpg" alt="" width="393" height="269" />
<h2>A blade for every task</h2>
A jigsaw will cut only as effectively as the blade that's in it. Its up-and-down “sewing machine” action gets the cutting done on the upstroke.

When selecting a wood-cutting blade, keep in mind:
<ul>
 	<li>The radius of the curve will meet how wide the blade should be. Blades 3/16 in. wide can cut tighter circles than those 3/8 in. wide, but they also break quicker.</li>
 	<li>The smoothness and speed at the cut you need will determine how many teeth the blade should have. One with 10 teeth per inch will induce a smoother, slower cut than a coarser-cutting blade with six teeth per inch.</li>
 	<li>The thickness and hardness of the wood will influence your choice of blade. Cutting a curve in 1-1/2 in. thick oak will require a thick, coarse blade.</li>
</ul>
Most blade manufacturers label their blades according to “best use," so follow their guidelines. In addition to wood-cutting blades, specialty blades are available.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Metal-cutting blades</strong> can cut soft steel, aluminum, and other metals and pipe up to 1/4 in. thick.</li>
 	<li><strong>Carbide-grit blades</strong> (photo 5) can cut odd shaves in ceramic tile, slate and even in brick.</li>
 	<li><strong>Knife blades</strong> (sharp-edged ones with no teeth) can cut leather, rubber, cardboard, and other materials.</li>
 	<li><strong>Remodeling-type blades</strong> are sturdy enough to cut through wood and nails.</li>
 	<li>Laminate-cutting blades, with teeth that cut on the downstroke, can cut through countertops without splintering the laminated surface.</li>
</ul>
Always make sure your blade is tightened securely in your jigsaw. Bosch and Porter-Cable require specially designed blades; most other saws accept a universal blade.

This versatile power tool is the grand master of cutting shapes—in lumber, plywood, sheet metal, even tile. You just need the right blade!

My jigsaw often sits for months just gathering dust. But then I'll need to cut out an intricate pattern for a hobby project, saw into a countertop to install a kitchen sink or cut a material like thin tile or metal that my other saws can't handle.

That's when I remember why I love this tool. It's a versatile tool a novice can safely operate, control and — with minimal instruction — enjoy good results from within minutes of picking it up. I'll show you how to get superior results cutting wood, plastic laminate, ceramic tile and metal.

<h2>How To Cut Wood With A Jigsaw</h2>
Jigsaws are ideal for cutting curves and complex shapes in wood (Photo 1).

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2277 size-full" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/jigsaw-01-cut-smooth-curves.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="575" />

<strong>Cut smooth curves in wood. Begin by pressing the saw shoe firmly on the workpiece with the blade away from the board's edge. Start the motor, guide the blade along the outside of the cutting line (for finer sanding later) and move from curves to inside corners. Always move the saw forward at a pace that allows the blade to cut without deflecting and doesn't make the motor labor. Prevent the saw blade from binding on tight curves by using relief cuts to remove waste.</strong>

They also work well for making short crosscuts on a board (Photo 2).

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2278 size-full" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/jigsaw-02-versatility-compound-cuts.jpg" alt="" width="630" height="623" />

<strong>A jigsaw is versatile enough to make straight, compound and beveled cuts through boards. Hold the workpiece firmly and guide the saw steadily against a saw fence. Avoid driving blades into the bench top (bending and breaking them) by using rails to raise the workpiece.</strong>

Jigsaws also work for finishing inside corner cuts (Photo 3) that you start with a circular saw.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2279 size-full" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/jigsaw-03-complete-inside-corner-cuts.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="622" />

<strong>A jigsaw can precisely complete cuts begun with a circular saw in stair stringers, wood flooring and sheet materials. To avoid bumps in your final stair stringer, hold the jigsaw blade tight to the inside of the stringer cutting line.</strong>

Jigsaws are not good for making fast, long, straight cuts. Use a circular saw instead. When cutting wood, follow these guidelines:
<ul>
 	<li>Jigsaws work best for cutting softwood that's no more than 1-1/2 in. thick and hardwood up to 3/4 in. thick. Jigsaw blades tend to bend when cutting curves in thicker boards, leaving a beveled edge rather than a square one. To keep the cut square, use a sharp blade and avoid forcing the saw through the cut.</li>
 	<li>To "plunge cut," that is, make an entry saw cut into the middle of your wood, tip the jigsaw so that the blade is parallel to the workpiece and the saw's weight rests on the front lip of the shoe. Start the saw at maximum speed, tilt the shoe and steadily lower the stabbing blade into the wood. I usually reserve plunge-cutting for rough work so that an errant blade doesn't slash and mar expensive woods. In fragile material, drill a 1/2-in. starter hole to safely position the blade for a cut.</li>
 	<li>For quick cutting, use a coarser blade. But note that the coarser the blade, the more sanding later.</li>
 	<li>Most wood-cutting blades for jigsaws are designed so the teeth cut on the upstroke. For fine work demanding less chipping — in wood veneers, for example — choose a "downstroke-cutting" blade (Photo 4). An alternative is to place painter's or masking tape on the cutting line path before drawing on the pattern line.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How To Cut Countertops With A Jigsaw</h2>
A jigsaw is perfectly suited for making the curved (or short diagonal) cuts at the corners of countertops and for the final long cut parallel to the backsplash. When installing a sink, make the front and two side cuts in the countertop with a circular saw. It's faster and there's no blade deflection to deal with.

The narrow space between the sink cutting line and the backsplash won't accommodate the wider circular saw shoe but lets the narrower shoe of most narrow-body jigsaws sneak in perfectly (Photo 4).

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2280" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/jigsaw-04-precise-cuts-in-laminate-564x404.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="404" />

<strong>Make precise, no-chip cuts in laminate by drilling a 1/2-in. starter hole in the countertop for the blade. Use a special laminate blade that cuts only on the down-stroke, and follow the cutting line drawn on masking tape. Avoid marring the countertop by taping the bottom of the saw shoe.</strong>

If you're not comfortable making countertop cuts with a circular saw, use a jigsaw for the whole job.

Cutting through a countertop with a jigsaw is slow-going. Choose a special down-cutting laminate blade. Its 5/16-in. wide blade, with eight teeth per inch, minimizes laminate chip-out. Use short relief cuts inside curves to ease the blade through the turn.
<h2>How To Cut Ceramic Tile With A Jigsaw</h2>
Cutting curves and shapes into tile with tile nippers and ceramic rod saws is slow and results in a lot of tile breakage. If you're cutting wall tile no more than 1/4 in. thick, try your jigsaw for this task.

Use special toothless, carbide-grit blades for tile cutting. For thin tile, apply water frequently to lubricate the saw cut. Thicker tile requires lubricating the saw cut with cutting oil.

To minimize tile breakage, it's imperative that you clamp your tile down tightly and hold the saw firmly on the tile to control saw and blade vibration. Avoid marring the tile by applying masking tape to the saw shoe. Go slow, using short relief cuts to remove waste and ease the blade through the turn.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2281 size-full" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/jigsaw-05-cut-ceramic-tile.jpg" alt="" width="691" height="470" />

<strong>Use a carbide-grit abrasive blade to make curved cuts in ceramic wall tile that's up to 1/4 in. thick. Speed the work and reduce tile breakage by clamping the tile and using a light mist of water to lubricate the saw cut. Jigsaws that have a movable scrolling head work best to move the blade through tight curves. This is slow work that demands patience, blade changes and relief cuts to open the tightest turns.</strong>
<h2>How To Cut Metal With A Jigsaw</h2>
With the proper blade, jigsaws can cut through wood with embedded nails, 1/8-in. mild steel, no-iron pipe and sheet metal up to 10 gauge thick (Photo 6).

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2282 size-full" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/jigsaw-06-cut-metal.jpg" alt="" width="593" height="557" />

<strong>Cut sheet metal without shredding it by clamping the workpiece tightly between two thin sheets of plywood. Begin by drilling saw blade starter holes inside all pattern circles. Cutting through a plywood sandwich is slow-going. For the smoothest cuts, select metal-cutting blades that have 21 to 24 teeth per inch.</strong>

For cutting sheet metal, choose a finer blade with 21 to 24 teeth per inch. To avoid shredding sheet metal or raising a lot of edge burrs, tightly sandwich the metal between two layers of thin plywood. Cut metal plate and pipe on low speed. For pattern cutting, drill blade starter holes instead of making plunge cuts. Expect it to take a while to cut through the sandwich. When cutting over a workbench or sawhorses, prop the sandwich on rails for adequate blade clearance below.

Features such as higher saw power, long blade stroke, variable speeds and orbital cutting action are all pluses for cutting metals, and are found on more costly jigsaws. Saws that are equipped with vacuum hose connections to keep the pattern cut sightlines free of dust also are a plus. Cutting pipe and mild steel plates wears out blades fast. Keep plenty of blades on hand, select a coarser blade (like 14 teeth per inch) and lubricate the saw cut with cutting oil.
<h2>Jigsaw &amp; Jigsaw Blades Basics</h2>
A jigsaw cuts in a rapid up-and-down motion. The key to excellent results with a jigsaw is to match a specific blade to the type of material you'll cut: wood, metal, plastics, tile, etc. The blade package will indicate what material the blade cuts best.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2275 size-full" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/jigsaw-00-blades.jpg" alt="" width="541" height="601" />

Most blades are carbon steel, 2 to 3-1/2 in. long and either 1/4 in. wide for making tight radius cuts or 3/8 in. wide for general-purpose cutting. Six-teeth-per-inch blades cut fast but rough; finer blades with 10 or more teeth per inch deliver smoother cuts. Special toothless blades cut everything from leather to tile. When buying blades, consider investing in bimetal blades. They cost slightly more than carbon steel blades but can last 10 times longer and are less likely to break.

When purchasing a saw, check to see what type of blades it uses. Most jigsaws accept blades with a 1/4-in. universal tang that locks into the blade clamp with a set screw. Some saws accept only specially designed blades (like bayonet-mount) from their own manufacturer. Once you discover the blades you use the most, stock up to avoid running out in the middle of a job.

Jigsaws prices vary a lot. One big difference between a cheap saw and an expensive one is the accuracy and rigidity of the blade guide. That's the small roller or mechanism that helps support the blade near the base of the saw (Photo 5). A well-constructed guide will help keep your blade perpendicular to the workpiece, help it follow the line of your cut more accurately, and minimize blade breakage.

If you'll only use a jigsaw once in a while, you may want to buy just a basic model. When you're ready to move up, you can spend more than 4 times extra for a heavy-duty saw that performs better and has more features, such as:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Orbital cutting action</strong>. If you've ever rocked a handsaw up and down while cutting a board or firewood, you've noticed how this speeds the cutting action. Jigsaws with this feature have dialed settings that change the pitch of the blade from straight up and down for metal cutting to angled forward for aggressively cutting wood.</li>
 	<li><strong>Longer blade stroke</strong>. Using a jigsaw that delivers a 1-in. long blade stroke will get you through a job faster than using a saw with a 1/2-in. long stroke.</li>
 	<li><strong>Blade guides</strong>. Saws so equipped have a pair of rollers or other guides below the blade clamping assembly to steady the blade for less bending and greater accuracy.</li>
 	<li><strong>Variable speeds</strong>. A jigsaw with preset speed settings or a variable speed trigger allows you to customize each cut and to slow down when you're at a tricky point in a pattern. This helps you work with a wide variety of materials and densities, too.</li>
 	<li><strong>Tilt-base</strong>. This allows you to adjust the base shoe, both left and right, for angle-cutting up to 45 degrees.</li>
</ol>
Another simple feature many tools have is a blower that directs air from the motor across the blade to keep the cutting line free of sawdust.

A circular guide (Photo 4) can help cut perfect circles ranging from 3 in. to 15 in. in diameter. You can make straight cuts with a special guide or by running the base shoe along a straight board tacked in place.
<h2>Cutting tips</h2>
Practice makes perfect with your jigsaw. Keep in mind:
<ul>
 	<li>Always start with the shoe of the jigsaw resting firmly on the workpiece and the workpiece damped or held firmly in place.</li>
 	<li>Make sure you have plenty of clearance for your blade below the project. I've bent and ruined dozens of blades by jamming the tip on a hard work surface under the project.</li>
 	<li>Make relief cuts (Photo 1) and complete your cutout in several small passes rather than one long, continuous cut. This will allow your blade to “corner” easier and allow you to approach the piece from different directions.</li>
 	<li>When precision is important, cut just to the outside of your mark, then sand to the line by hand or with a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/how-to-choose-a-random-orbit-sander/">random-orbit sander</a>. Even the finest blades leave a bit of a rough cut; leave yourself some time and room for sanding.</li>
 	<li>Make cuts in the center of boards by drilling a small starter hole or by making a plunge cut as shown in Photo 2.</li>
 	<li>Because of a jigsaw’s up-and-down action, jigsaw blades lend to splinter thin veneers and plywoods. Prevent this by using an <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/can-you-cut-plywood-with-a-jigsaw/">anti-splintering jigsaw blade</a> or by sandwiching your workpiece between thin layers or scrap plywood. Jigsaw blades tend to wander. While you may be following your line exactly on the surface, the blade below may be angling inward or outward. This is especially a problem when making turns in thick woods or when using the orbital action found on some saws. Minimize wander by using a blade stout enough tor the job and making relief cuts so your blade can get back on track as necessary.</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Some folks like old-style <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_arm_saw">radial arm saws</a> – if you watch youtube videos like I do, you might have seen Frank Howarth or The Homestead Craftsman with two radial arm saws (each) in their woodshops, you also know this is not a simple matter of age or woodworking style.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1383" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/radial-arm-saw.jpg" alt="" width="674" height="577" />
<h2>What can you use a radial arm saw for?</h2>
<strong>Crosscutting</strong> is what all the radial arm saw was designed to do — and what it does best. This saw's ability to make a variety of cuts, its reasonable cost, and its compactness make it popular with DlYers.

There are other uses, too:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Miter cuts</strong>. The saw arm can be swung left or right for angle cuts of 45 degrees or more. Hold the workpiece firmly against the fence.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1384" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/radial-arm-saw-1-miter-cuts.jpg" alt="" width="372" height="331" />
<ol start="2">
 	<li><strong>Rip cuts</strong>. The blade can be rotated and locked at 90 degrees for ripping. Use splinter and anti-kickback pawls to prevent binding and kickback.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1385" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/radial-arm-saw-2-rip-cuts.jpg" alt="" width="356" height="330" />
<ol start="3">
 	<li><strong>Bevel cuts</strong>. The blade can be tilted and elevated for decorative cuts.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1386" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/radial-arm-saw-3-bevel-cuts.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="311" />
<ol start="4">
 	<li><strong>Compound miter cuts</strong>. Radial arm saws can be set to bevel-cut and angle-cut at the same time for special projects.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1387" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/radial-arm-saw-4-compound-miter-cuts.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="309" />
<ol start="5">
 	<li></li>
</ol>
<strong>Dado and rabbet cuts</strong>. With board and blade visible, it’s easy to control depth, length, and position of cut.

<ol start="6">
 	<li><strong>Drum sander</strong>. This is one of the many attachments designed to fit on the accessory shaft or blade shaft of a radial arm saw motor.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Do you need a radial arm saw?</h2>
My neighbor across the street calls his radial arm saw his “woodworking Swiss Army knife.” He loves the way it can be quickly adjusted to out like a table saw, miter box or circular saw.

My neighbor two doors down, however, calls his radial arm his “jack-of-all-trades, master of none." He likes the convenience of a single tool that's pretty good at three or four different tasks — but feels this versatility has its trade-offs. particularly in terms of accuracy.

Both neighbors have their points. A radial arm saw can rip boards to width, miter trim and cut boards to length. But its very design — a heavy motor and blade, suspended from a long arm — makes it a tool that can lack precision.

Whether or not a radial arm saw is for you depends on the projects you do and how much “perfectionist” there is in you. A good. basic radial arm saw is great when it comes to building a deck or making everyday repairs. But for line furniture-making or cutting interior window trim, single-purpose tools like a miter saw or table saw will serve you better.

Following is a quick radial arm saw primer, including a rating for each type of cut — to give you an idea of this tool’s strengths and weaknesses.
<h2>(Proper) Radial arm saw set up</h2>
Whether your saw is new, used or being dragged out of mothballs, it’s essential you spend the time (probably a solid afternoon) to set it up and adjust it properly. Most owner's manuals include this "tuneup" information. A high-quality 40- or 60-tooth carbide blade is another must.

Acquaint yourself with the operations of your saw; switching from one type of cut to another usually involves loosening, adjusting, then retightening two levers or cranks. With practice, you can switch from one operation to another in less than a minute.
<h2>What is the Safest Blade for Crosscutting with Radial Arm Saws?</h2>
Crosscutting with my radial arm saw can make inexperienced woodworkers and carpenters a little nervous. If you're not careful, the blade tries to pull itself through the board and sometimes jams in the wood. Is there a way to prevent this?

The problem with radial arm saws (and sliding compound miter saws) is that the rotation of the blade tends to propel it in the same direction as the cut. Consequently, a blade with a hooked or positive rake angle tries to pull itself through the cut — even without your help. <strong>To compensate, some pros pull the motor and blade forward, then position the workpiece, and push (instead of pull) the blade through the wood.</strong>

But <strong>another option that will make cutting with your radial arm saw much easier and safer is to install a blade that has teeth with a zero or negative rake angle</strong>. The less aggressive angle greatly reduces the blade's tendency to pull itself along. Not only will the saw be safer to operate, but without the shock caused by a jammed blade, your saw will also need less adjusting.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2287 size-full" src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/radial-arm-saw-blade-negative-rake-angle.png" alt="" width="757" height="805" />

A high-quality 10-in. carbide blade with a negative rake angle is available at many lumberyards and home centers. Also, the blade should say it's specifically made for radial arm and sliding compound miter saws.
<h2>Crosscutting (10/10)</h2>
A radial arm saw with a 10-in. dia. Blade can cut boards up to 3 in. thick and 14 in. wide with excellent results. It can also cut several boards laid side-by-side in a single pass.

Pull firmly and evenly for the crispest cut (opening photo). The spinning blade wants to pull itself toward you, so maintain a “stiff” arm as you pull.

Here are a few points to remember:
<ul>
 	<li>Cut boards good side up. To prevent <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/can-you-cut-plywood-with-a-jigsaw/">splintering</a> the back side, place a scrap piece of plywood beneath your project.</li>
 	<li>Clamp a small piece of wood to the table as a stop to make repetitive cuts.</li>
 	<li>For safety's sake. support both ends of long boards with sawhorses or roller stands and never place your arm in the path of the saw blade.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mitering (7/10)</h2>
A radial arm saw can cut miters on wide, thick pieces of wood when a miter box saw can’t. Many can cut at angles exceeding 45 degrees (Photo 1).

Keep these tips in mind:
<ul>
 	<li>Cut the board about 1/16 in. too long on the first pass, then slice it to exact length with a second pass. This will strain the blade less and leave a smoother, more accurate cut.</li>
 	<li>The blade can extend beyond the main work table on along. left miter, exposing the blade. Be careful.</li>
 	<li>Saws have built-in stops that automatically lock at 45 degrees. Check and adjust these settings for accuracy if you miter-cut frequently.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ripping (5/10)</h2>
Radial arms do a fair job of cutting lumber, plywood and paneling to width — but it can be awkward. Always feed the board against the rotation of the blade (Photo 2) Use all safety devices, goggles, and extreme care.

Keep in mind:
<ul>
 	<li>The fence can be set farther back on the table to increase rip capacity.</li>
 	<li>Rough-cut large panels to approximate width with a circular saw before ripping on the radial arm.</li>
 	<li>Ripping can be a two-person job, especially for large panels.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compound angles (10/10)</h2>
Except for a few professional tools, the radial arm saw is the best tool around for making combination bevel and miter cuts (Photo 4).

With the blade at a compound angle, it‘s straining through more wood than it normally would. Pull the blade slowly so it doesn't hog, and hold the board firmly so it doesn’t pull itself out of position.

Also keep in mind: odd angles make odd cutouts in your rip fence; you'll need to replace it more often.
<h2>Dadoing (7/10)</h2>
Making grooves (Photo 5) on a radial arm saw allows you to watch the depth, length, and position of the cut as it’s being made.

When using a dado blade to cut a deep groove, make two or three passes, lowering the blade slightly each time.

You can also make dado cuts with a normal blade. Make the two outside cuts first, then remove center waste with a series of cuts.
<h2>Operating and safety tips</h2>
A radial arm saw has knobs, levers, and cranks galore. Make certain each one is adjusted and locked before using the saw.

These tips will help, too:
<ul>
 	<li>For each new angle cut, make a small groove in the fence and table by lowering the rotating blade into them, then raising up slightly.</li>
 	<li>Hit the Off switch immediately if the blade is frozen by a knot or from being fed into the wood too quickly. Practice this move like a gunslinger going for his gun. Free the blade, then start your cut over again.</li>
 	<li>You can equip your saw with many accessories. The drum sander (Photo 6) is one attachment that mounts easily and works well. Others, like molding blades for cutting designs onto the edge or face of a board, are more gimmicky. Use a router instead.</li>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Wow, a giant building block that rolls and has a drawer too! Not that your kids or grandkids will actually put their toys away, but with a storage box like this to tempt them, who knows what miracles might happen!

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/diy-toy-storage-box-00-opening-818x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="697" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2133" />

This is a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/new-hobby-woodworking/">fun project to build</a>, but it does take some time and effort to get it to look really good. To make it user-friendly, it features rounded corners, self-balancing lid supports and an easy-on-the-fingers drawer that won't slam shut.

Building this project takes about three weekends. All the hardware used is available online.

<h2>Tools Needed</h2>

You'll need:

<ul><li>a table saw and dado blade,</li>
<li>a router and a 1/4-in. dia. round-over bit, a 1/2-in. dia. round-over bit, and a 3/4-in. long flush-trimming bit,</li>
<li>a belt sander and a 150-grit sanding belt,</li>
<li>an <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/random-orbit-sander/">orbital sander</a>,</li>
<li>a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-drill-driver-kit/">drill/driver</a>,</li>
<li>a jigsaw,</li>
<li>a hacksaw, and</li>
<li>at least four 30-in. or longer bar or pipe clamps.</li></ul>

You will see pictures of a scroll saw to cut out the letters. But you can use a jigsaw too.

This project also uses a drill press and a 1-in. dia. sanding drum to smooth the sawn edges of the letters. A simple replacement is an ordinary electric drill to do the job. Or, obviously, an oscillating spindle sander.

<h2>Step-By-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Cut All Pieces</h3>

<a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-circular-saw/">Cut all the pieces</a>, A through U, to the dimensions given in the Cutting List below:

[table id=47 /]

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/diy-toy-storage-box-fig-a-toy-box-assembly-exploded-view-776x1024.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="735" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2143" />

<h3>2. Glue & Clamp Solid Wood Edging Pieces To Plywood</h3>

Glue and clamp the edging pieces T to the top and bottom edges of the sides, front and back (B and D), and to the sides of the top (C).

Before you assemble the box, there's a lot of edge-gluing to do. Here's how I like to do it.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/diy-toy-storage-box-01-gluing-solid-wood-edging-to-plywood.jpg" alt="" width="533" height="428" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2134" />

<ol><li>Cut the edging pieces so they're about 1/32 in. thicker and 1 in. longer than the plywood.</li>
<li>Attach one edging piece at a time.</li>
<li>Apply a bead of glue (about 1/8 in. dia.) near each edge of the piece being attached.</li>
<li>Then align and clamp it to one end of the plywood piece.</li>
<li>Put another clamp 4 to 6 in. away from the first clamp and apply a little pressure.</li>
<li>Put your finger over the joint near the clamp.</li>
<li>Grab the other end of the edging piece with your other hand.</li>
<li>Move the end up or down until you feel with your finger that the edging piece is aligned with each face of the plywood, allowing for a little overhang, then tighten the clamp.</li>
<li>Continue doing this all the way down the length of the edging piece.</li>
<li>Dampen a rag with hot water, and wipe off the oozed-out glue.</li>
<li>Let the glue joint dry, then attach the opposite edging piece.</li>
<li>Trim off the overhanging ends, and attach the remaining edging pieces to the plywood.</li>
<li>Use a 150-grit belt with your belt sander to sand the edging pieces flush with the plywood. <strong>Be careful</strong>; the plywood's veneer is very thin, and it's easy to sand right through it. To prevent this, draw zigzag pencil lines over the joints, and sand just until the lines disappear, or become faint.</li>
<li>If you've never done this before, practice on a scrap first.</li></ol>

Trim off the overhanging ends, then glue and clamp the remaining edging pieces to the sides (B) and top (C).

Also, glue and clamp the top front (M) to the top. Then draw a pencil line even with the edge of the plywood and trim off the overhanging ends with your jigsaw.

<strong>Tip</strong>: Use only one bead of glue (about 1/8 in. dia.) near the outside edge of the joint when gluing the sides to the front and back. This will reduce the amount of glue that will ooze out on the inside corners when you clamp the pieces.

<h3>3. Sand Edging Pieces Flush</h3>

Use a belt sander with a 150-grit sanding belt to sand the edging pieces flush with the faces of the plywood.

<h3>4. Finish-Sand Inside Surfaces</h3>

Use an orbital sander to finish-sand the inside surfaces of the sides, front, back and top.

Start with 150-grit sandpaper, then use 180-grit.

<h3>5. Glue & Clamp Back, Lower Back, And Front To One Side</h3>

Glue and clamp the back (D), lower back (N). and front (B) to one side.

Make sure the top edge of the back is 1/8 in. below the top edge of the side, and that the drawer opening is 6 in. wide as shown in Fig. A.

After the glue is dry, glue, and clamp the other side in place.

<h3>6. Mark Location Of Drawer Stop Access</h3>

Mark the location of the drawer stop access hole in the lower bottom (A) and cut it out with a jigsaw.

<h3>7. Lay Out, Countersink, and Drill</h3>

Layout, countersink, and drill all the drywall screw holes in the bottoms (A), drawer bottom (E), cleats (P and Q), drawer runners (R and S) and drawer stop latch (U).

<h3>8. Mount The Lower Bottom</h3>

Mount the lower bottom next.

Start by trimming the width of the cleats (P and Q) so they're equal to 2-1/4 in. minus the thickness of the lower bottom (see Fig. A).

Glue and screw the pieces to the inside of the box in this order: cleats (P) to the sides, cleats (Q) to the front and back, lower bottom (A) to cleats (P and Q), lower drawer runners (R) to the sides, lower drawer runners (S) to the front and back, and finally, the drawer stop (S) to the lower bottom (A).

<h3>9. Mount Upper Bottom</h3>

Mount the upper bottom next.

Glue and screw the upper drawer runners (R and S) in place (Photo 2).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/diy-toy-storage-box-02-use-spacer-to-align-drawer-runners.jpg" alt="" width="572" height="506" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2135" />

<strong>Use a 6-in. x 20-in. piece of 3/4-in. thick scrap plywood as a spacer to align the upper drawer runners as you glue and screw them to the box. 

Finish-sand the top of the upper bottom, then glue and screw it to the upper drawer runners. 

<h3>10. Mounting The Piano Hinge</h3>

This wouldn't be much of a problem if we had mounted the hinge with the flaps on the outside of the top and box. But although it's trickier, mounting the piano hinge so the flaps are concealed when the top is closed looks much neater. Here's how.

Use a hacksaw to cut the piano hinge to length so it fits on the top edge of the back. Smooth both ends of the hinge with a fine metal file.

Then, align the hinge so the bottoms of the hinge knuckle openings are flush with the outside edge of the back. Drill pilot holes, then screw the hinge in place (Photo 3).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/diy-toy-storage-box-03-screw-hinge-to-the-box.jpg" alt="" width="541" height="538" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2136" />

Now it is time to screw the hinge to the top next (Photo 4).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/diy-toy-storage-box-04-screw-hinge-to-the-top.jpg" alt="" width="543" height="539" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2137" />

When mounted properly, the edge of the top will slightly overhang the sides and front of the box. You'll trim off these overhanging edges later.

Cut two 7/8-in. tall x 26-in. long riser blocks from scrap wood. Set the back of the box on the riser blocks and slide the top under the hinge.

Visually align the sides of the hinge. Visually align the sides of the top with the sides of the box, and the bottoms of the hinge knuckle openings with the back edge of the top.

Drill a pilot hole and insert a screw at one end of the hinge. Close the top and check its alignment. If it needs adjusting, remove the screw, adjust the top and insert a screw in the next hole.

When you get that side aligned, do the other side. Fill any unused screw holes with short pieces of toothpicks and glue. Then insert the rest of the hinge screws.

<h3>11. Round The Corners Of The Top</h3>

Clamp the top down to the box.

Using a router and a flush-trimming bit, trim off the edges of the top that over-hang the sides and front. Remove the piano hinge because it will interfere with routing the back edges. Then align and clamp the top to the box again, and round the top's corners with a router and a 1/2-in. dia. round-over bit (Photo 5).

Remove the top and round over the outside edges of the top and box.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/diy-toy-storage-box-05-round-corners-of-the-top.jpg" alt="" width="568" height="561" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2138" />

<strong>Round the corners of the top this way to avoid accidentally rounding over the bottom edges of the top, and to avoid tearing out the wood.</strong>

<h3>12. Lay Out & Cut Hand Holes</h3>

Layout and cut out the hand holes in the top front (M) and drawer front (IQ. Use a 1-1/2 in. dia. hole saw to cut open the ends of the hand holes for the lid and the drawer front.

Then use a file to smooth the sawn edges, then round over the edges with a router and a 1/4-in. round-over bit.

<h3>13. Making The Drawers</h3>

Cut the rabbets and dado grooves in the drawer sides (J) and front (K).

Finish-sand the insides of the drawer sides, front and back, then glue and clamp the pieces together.

Drill pilot holes and hammer in the 1-1/2 in. brads, then fill the brad holes with putty, and finish-sand the rest of the drawer.

Don't put the drawer bottom in just yet, because you'll want to apply the finish before you attach it.

<h3>14. Round-Overs & Smoothing The Edges</h3>

Shaping the rounded corners of the letter frame tops and bottoms would take a lot of time if you did them individually. "Gang" routing them is quick, and all of the pieces end up exactly the same shape.

Align and sandwich the hardboard pieces between two pieces of scrap wood cut the same size as the hardboard pieces.

Then clamp the whole thing to your work table and rout the frame ends all at once using a 1/2-in. dia. round-over bit.

Round the outside corners of the letter frame tops and bottoms (G), as shown in Photo 6.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/diy-toy-storage-box-06-making-multiple-roundovers.jpg" alt="" width="563" height="627" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2139" />

Transfer and enlarge the letter shapes from our grids in Fig. B to your pieces of hardboard.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/diy-toy-storage-box-fig-b-letter-templates.jpg" alt="" width="722" height="322" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2144" />

Cut out the letters (Photo 7).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/diy-toy-storage-box-07-cut-shapes-of-letters.jpg" alt="" width="541" height="530" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2140" />

<strong>Cut out the shapes of the letters using a scroll saw. Drill holes in the "A" and "B" to get the blade through to cut the inside shapes.</strong>

Now it is time to sand the sawn edges smooth (Photo 8).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/diy-toy-storage-box-08-smooth-edges-with-sanding-drum.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2141" />

<strong>Smooth the scroll-sawn edges of the letters with a drill press and a 1-in. dia. sanding drum.</strong>

<h3>15. Finish-Sanding</h3>

To make the toy box more user-friendly, finish-sand the letter surfaces and all of the exposed sharp edges.

<h3>16. Prepare For Painting</h3>

Don't paint the underside of the letters and frames because you'll need to apply glue to them later.

Align the letter frame pieces and letters on the box and trace around them with a pencil.

Cover the areas inside the letter tracings with masking tape about 1/4 in. in from the pencil lines.

<strong>Tip</strong>: Cover the letter and frame areas on the box with masking tape before spraying with primer. This ensures that the glue will bond the hardboard letters and frame pieces to the plywood sides and back.

Use newspaper and masking tape to cover the other unpainted surfaces of the box, then apply the spray primer (Photo 9).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/diy-toy-storage-box-09-cover-unpainted-birch-surfaces.jpg" alt="" width="571" height="511" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2142" />

<strong>Cover the unpainted birch surfaces with masking tape and newspaper. Apply the primer, let it dry, then apply the white enamel. For an even more colorful toy box, you can vary the color scheme for each lettered side.</strong>

Apply the primer to the tops and edges of the letters and letter frame pieces too. Apply at least two coats to the hardboard edges because they really soak up the primer.

<h3>17. Spray Painting & Assembly</h3>

Apply the white spray enamel to the box once the primer has dried, then spray the red enamel on the letters and letter frame pieces. When the spray paint is dry, remove all of the masking tape and newspaper.

Now, align and glue the letter frames and letters on the box. Do one side at a time with the side you're working on facing up. Apply glue to the back of one letter frame top piece. Align it and press it in place with your hands; no clamping is necessary.

Attach the other three frame pieces, then glue the letter to the box. Let the glue dry, then do the other letter frames and letters the same way, one side at a time.

<h3>18. Apply Finishing</h3>

Brush two coats of polyurethane on all the unpainted birch surfaces and let it dry. Next, apply the spray polyurethane to the painted surfaces. Do one side face up at a time.

Let the finish dry before doing the next side. Spray light coats of the finish to avoid drips. Let the finish cure for at least one week before using the project.

<h3>19. Mount Casters & Lid Supports</h3>

Mount the casters to the bottom.

Remount the top and mount the lid supports, using the lid support mounting dimensions given in Fig. A to prevent pinched fingers. Adjust the tension of the lid supports so they hold the top open in any position.

Stick felt dots on the front corners of the top.

<strong>Tip</strong>: To help make this toy storage box safe, use the type of lid supports displayed in the photos. These self-balancing lid supports keep the top open in any position to prevent entrapment, and help protect little fingers as well.

<h3>20. Mount The Drawer</h3>

Mount the drawer bottom and drawer stop. Rub a little paraffin on the drawer runners for a smooth-running drawer.

Now, insert the drawer in its opening, reach underneath and through the access hole, and turn the drawer stop latch down so it hits the drawer stop.

Now you're ready to start picking up the toys.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="box">The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015DVN4E4/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Dremel 8050-N/18 Micro Rotary Tool Kit with 18 Accessories</a> is the best cordless Dremel rotary tool. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015DVN4E4/?tag=bestlife52-text-20" rel="nofollow">Click here</a> to find out today's discount.<br><img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Dremel-8050-N-18-Micro-Rotary-Tool-Kit-with-18-Accessories-ENGRAVING-DETAILS-564x564.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="564" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2174" /></p>

The Dremel is the Mighty Mouse of the power tool world. What it lacks in size and strength, it makes up for in speed and maneuverability. Plus, many a time it has (at least in my do-it-yourself adventures) zoomed in to "save the day."

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Dremel-8050-N-18-Micro-Rotary-Tool-Kit-with-18-Accessories-CLEANING-564x564.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="564" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2172" />

The rotary tool's versatility has made it a favorite of model makers, mechanics, and DIYers for years.

Depending on the accessory you tighten into its chuck, it can polish, cut, drill, grind, engrave, clean, sand and carve.

It's easy to control and can get into nooks and crannies that large grinders or sanding tools simply can't.

Here's the buzz.

<h2>What is a Dremel Tool?</h2>

Generically it's called a "high-speed rotary tool," but the DIYer on the street calls this a "Dremel." Not many other tools fit the same pigeonhole. Big box stores offer models — manufactured by (surprise!) Dremel.

As far as I know, no other manufacturer offers a comparable tool. Specialty woodworking stores carry tools that operate permanently in a flexible shaft mode, but they're pricey.

Dremel offers a variety of electric and battery-powered tools ranging from a cordless, two-speed model to an electric, variable speed model with all the bells and whistles.

You can buy a middle-of-the-road model with variable-speed, a case, and some bits and accessories to get you started; it's most likely all the Dremel tool you'll ever need.

<h2>How Do You PROPERLY Use a Dremel Tool?</h2>

The key to using a rotary tool successfully is to let the high speed of the tool do the work. Don't force the tool or apply much pressure — let the 30,000 rpm do the work.

Make a series of light passes to complete the job. Since many of the bits and discs are small and thin, undue pressure can break or quickly dull them. Work with a light, steady hand.

Always wear <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/eye-protection/">protective eyewear</a>; I've had fragile cut-off wheels break at 30,000 rpm and might have been injured without my safety goggles.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cordless-dremel-rotary-tool-00-remove-paint-smooth-surfaces-564x452.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="452" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2152" />

<strong>Remove paint and smooth surfaces using the Dremel tool and sanding drum. Dremel tools — versatile and precise — can be used with or without the stand and flexible shaft shown.</strong>

Also, take care not to block the air vents along the sides of the tool. These openings allow air to circulate around the motor to keep it cool.

<h2>Select the Right Accessory</h2>

A trip through the tool catalog reveals 130 different bits, stones, cutters and grinders made for Moto-Tools. And hundreds of additional accessories are offered by other manufacturers—just make sure they're rated for speeds up to 30,000 rpm.

Dremel tools excel at:

<h3>Sharpening</h3>

Aluminum oxide grinding stones, in a variety of shapes and sizes, make for easy, precision sharpening of small tools (such as wire cutters and aviation snips) or tools with strangely shaped cutting blades (like curved pruning shears or spurred drill bits). Mount either the dull tool or the Dremel in a vise for stability (Photo 1). To avoid burning the edge, sharpen in four- to five-second spurts, then examine the tool edge while it cools.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cordless-dremel-rotary-tool-01-sharpen-with-grinding-wheel-564x534.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="534" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2153" />

<strong>Sharpen small and oddly shaped tools with a grinding wheel accessory. Work in short spurts so you don't over-heat the tool edge and weaken it.</strong>

<h3>Sanding</h3>

Their small size makes Dremel sanding accessories unsuitable for smoothing large surfaces, but ideal for nooks and crannies. Use a sanding drum (opening photo), available in a variety of grits, and diameters, to smooth cutouts and curved surfaces. Use sanding discs for smoothing small surfaces, slots, and grooves.

<h3>Engraving</h3>

Use a small-tipped engraving cutter (Photo 2) to mark your name or identification number on wood, metal, and plastic.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Dremel-8050-N-18-Micro-Rotary-Tool-Kit-with-18-Accessories-ENGRAVING-METAL-564x564.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="564" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2176" />

Try the cutter on scrap metal before labeling any beloved tools or belongings; the tip tends to wander, but you can control it with practice. For the best control, hold the tip fairly square to the surface being marked.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cordless-dremel-rotary-tool-02-engrave-on-plastic-wood-564x557.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="557" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2154" />

<strong>Engrave your name or identification number on often-borrowed tools or belongings. There are different engraving tips for different materials, such as plastic and wood.</strong>

<h3>Grinding and Cutting Metal</h3>

This is where the Dremel tool excels.

Use grinding stones (Photo 4) to enlarge and shape holes in metal. Use cut-off wheels (Photo 3) to cut new slots in stripped screwheads, remove rivet and bolt heads, and square up a rounded bolt head so a wrench can fit.

For accuracy, hold the tool firmly with both hands while grinding or cutting.

<strong>Cut slots in stubborn bolts, so a large screwdriver can remove them. Emery and heavy-duty fiberglass reinforced cut-off wheels can also cut through rusted nuts and screws.</strong>

<strong>Enlarge a strike plate so the latch will fit. Grinding stones can also grind off rivet heads or remove burrs from rough-cut metal pipes and thresholds.</strong>

<h3>Drilling</h3>

The small profile of the Dremel tool allows it access to tight spaces where a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-drill-driver-kit/">normal drill</a> can't fit (Photo 5).

Before drilling metal, use a punch to create a starting dimple for the <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/best-drill-bit-set/">drill bit</a>. When drilling, adjust variable speed tools to their slowest setting.

<strong>A Dremel tool lets you drill holes where a larger tool might not fit. Use the slowest speed setting on variable speed tools.</strong>

<h3>Cleaning and Polishing</h3>

Use a wire brush wheel for removing rust and paint, then a polishing wheel (Photo 6) to make metals shine.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cordless-dremel-rotary-tool-06-buff-shine-metal-objects-564x481.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="481" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2158" />

<strong>Buff and shine metal objects ranging from musical instruments to door hardware. Apply polishing com-pound to the wheel, then buff.</strong>

Variable speed models operate at a range of 5,000 to 30,000 rpm. Use low speeds when working on plastics or other materials that might melt when worked at higher speeds.

<h2>Rotary Tool Attachments</h2>

The most useful attachment on my Dremel tool is the "keyless chuck" (Photo 1), which allows bits to be secured without a wrench. The keyless chuck will accept all size shanks, plus release bits more easily than the standard chuck that requires a wrench.

You can also buy attachments that will turn your Dremel into a router, router table, drill press or chain saw sharpener.

Use the Dremel stand (Photo 1) to free up both hands for guiding tools and materials past the spinning bit.

The flexible shaft (opening photo), because it's lighter and easier to manipulate than the tool itself, is perfect when you're working for long periods or on delicate projects.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The beauty of this kitchen shelf lies in the details, like the finger-jointed drawers, square screw cover plugs, and the matching, shop-made drawer pulls. Even a little detail like hiding the hanging bracket adds to the project's beauty, offering uninterrupted, clean lines.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/hard-maple-kitchen-shelf-00-opening-564x384.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="384" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2182" />

The trick to mastering the details is to test all your setups on scrap wood before making your final cuts. Take your time <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/new-hobby-woodworking/">cutting, aligning and fitting the parts together</a>. Figure on spending about $200 and two weekends to build it.

<h2>About Working With Hard Maple</h2>

Hard maple is exactly that, hard. Cutting it requires sharp tools, and sanding it takes a little longer than sanding most other hardwoods. We made our shelf from maple because we liked its rich, creamy color and subtle grain pattern.

Hard maple is a common hardwood available at hardwood lumberyards. It's usually 3/4 in. thick, so you'll need to plane some of it to 1/2 in. thick for the drawers (see the Cutting List). If you don't have a thickness planer and a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/benchtop-jointer/">jointer</a>, ask the lumberyard personnel to do it for you.

The maple was finished with clear semi-gloss spray lacquer, no stain. You can stain maple, but it's tricky and sometimes turns out blotchy. If you're thinking about staining yours, do a test sample on a piece of scrap wood first.

<h2>Tools You'll Need For This Project</h2>

Aside from some basic hand tools, you'll need:

<ul><li>a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/table-saw-jigs-instructions/">table saw</a> with a miter gauge and a stacking-type dado blade,</li>
<li>a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/how-to-use-a-jigsaw/">jigsaw</a>,</li>
<li>a belt sander,</li>
<li>a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/random-orbit-sander/">random orbital sander</a>,</li>
<li>a router and a 3/8-in. dia. rabbet bit,</li>
<li>a sharp <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/how-to-use-a-wood-chisel-safely/">1/2-in. Chisel</a>,</li>
<li>a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-drill-driver-kit/">drill</a>,</li>
<li>a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/best-drill-bit-set/">1/2-in. spade or Forstner-type drill bit</a>, and</li>
<li>at least four 12-in. or longer bar clamps.</li></ul>

A few spring clamps come in handy too.

If you have a thickness planer, drill press and a woodworking <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/garage-workbench-plans/">workbench</a> with a wood vise, you can speed things along, but you'll manage without them.

<h2>Step-By-Step Instructions</h2>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/hard-maple-kitchen-shelf-fig-a-kitchen-shelf-free-plans-444x564.jpg" alt="" width="444" height="564" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2192" />

<h3>1. Edge-Glue Boards & Cut All Pieces</h3>

Edge-glue boards to make pieces wide enough for the bottom, shelf, sides and drawer dividers (A, B and C).

Now cut all the pieces to the sizes given in the Cutting List.

Cut the 1/16-in. thick drawer runners (N) off the edge of a 1-in. wide piece of 3/4-in. thick maple.

To get continuous grain across the drawer fronts, cut the drawer fronts (E) from one long piece. Label the pieces so you'll know how to assemble the drawers so the grain will flow across the front of the shelf.

<h3>2. Cut The Sides</h3>

Layout the shape of the sides (B) and cut them with a jigsaw, then sand the sawn edges smooth.

<h3>3. Layout Screw Holes</h3>

Layout, counterbore and drill the screw holes in the bottom, shelf and sides (A and B).

<h3>4. Chisel The Square Holes</h3>

Using a combination square, draw squares around all the 1/2-in. dia. counterbored holes.

Using a 1/2-in. chisel, and the drawn lines as guides, "chop" open the round holes, turning them into square holes as shown in Photo 1.

For best results, cut across the grain first (Photo 1 inset), then with the grain.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/hard-maple-kitchen-shelf-01-use-sharp-chisel-564x403.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="403" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2183" />

<strong>Use a sharp chisel to "chop" open the round holes so the square plugs will fit. Cut across the grain first, then cut with the grain.</strong>

<h3>5. Case Assembly</h3>

Assemble the case next. Start by cutting three 8 x 11-in. spacers from 3/4-in. scrap plywood.

Align and clamp the spacers to the bottom (A) so each drawer opening will be 11 in. wide.

Set the drawer dividers (C) in the slots between the spacers, and drill screw pilot holes in the drawer dividers.

Glue and screw the dividers to the bottom and remove the spacers.

Attach the shelf (A) to the dividers the same way.

<h3>6. Making The Square Screw Cover Plugs</h3>

Using a jigsaw or handsaw, cut twenty-four 3/8-in. long square screw cover plugs from the 1/2-in. x 1/2-in. x 20-in. piece (K) you cut earlier.

If necessary, sand the edges of the plugs so they fit tight in the square holes.

Glue and hammer the plugs into the square holes in the bottom and shelf, then let the glue dry.

Use a belt sander with a 120-grit sanding belt to sand the plugs flush with the bottom and shelf.

<h3>7. Cut The Beveled Edges</h3>

Cut the beveled edges of the top, wall hanger and wall cleat (D and G) with your table saw.

Glue and clamp the wall hanger, back and bottom of back together (G, L, and M).

<h3>8. Finish-Sand</h3>

Using an orbital sander with 120-grit sandpaper first, then 180-grit, finish-sand the outsides of the shelf and bottom.

Then do the insides of the sides and top and the exposed surfaces of the back (L and M).

<h3>9. Attach The Sides To The Case</h3>

Glue and screw the sides (B) to the shelf and bottom, then the sides to the top (D).

Glue and clamp the back to the top, then insert the remaining screw cover plugs as you did before.

<h3>1O. Add The Drawer Stops & Runners</h3>

Glue and clamp the drawer stops (H) to the bottom, then glue and press (no clamps needed) the drawer runners in place.

Sand the top and bottom of the sides so they're flush with the top and bottom pieces.

Then finish-sand the outside of the assembled shelf.

<h3>11. Cutting The Finger Joints</h3>

Make the drawers next. Cut the finger joints on the ends of the drawer fronts, backs and sides (E and F).

Finger joints, also known as "box joints," are a strong and decorative way to assemble drawers or other projects with 90-degree joints.

Cutting the joints is fast once you set up the cutting jig. For nice, tight-fitting joints, the width of the fingers must be equal to the width of the slots cut between the fingers. Here's how to do it.

Make a 3/4-in. x 4-in. x 15-in. fence and clamp it to your miter gauge. Mount a 1/4-in. wide dado blade in your table saw and set the blade height to 1/2 in. Cut a slot in the fence (Photo 2), then remove the fence.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/hard-maple-kitchen-shelf-02-start-making-jig-541x564.jpg" alt="" width="541" height="564" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2184" />

<strong>Start making the finger joint cutting jig by clamping a fence to your miter gauge. Cut a 1/4-in. wide x 1/2-in. tall slot about 4 in. from the end.</strong>

Cut an 8-in. long piece of wood to fit tightly in the fence's slot. This piece is called a "spline." It's best to use a different saw to cut the spline so you don't disturb the dado blade setup.

Cut a 2-in. long piece off the spline and glue it in the fence's slot so it sticks out the front. Set the extra spline piece against the side of the dado blade. Push the fence's spline against the outside of the extra spline, then clamp the fence to the miter gauge (Photo 3).

Screw the fence to the miter gauge and remove the clamp and extra spline piece.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/hard-maple-kitchen-shelf-03-set-space-using-extra-spline-543x564.jpg" alt="" width="543" height="564" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2185" />

<strong>Set the space between the fence's spline and the dado blade using the extra spline piece. The fingers and slots will be the same width when they're cut.</strong>

<strong>Tip</strong>: Before you cut the finger joints, it's a good idea to label each piece according to its location. This will make for easier assembly later.

Raise the dado blade an additional 1/32 in., to make it 17/32 in. high. When you cut the slots, the fingers will be 1/32 in. too long. You'll trim off the extra after you assemble the drawers.

Cut the slots in the ends of the drawer fronts and backs (E) first. Hold a drawer front against the fence and spline, and cut the first slot (Photo 4).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/hard-maple-kitchen-shelf-04-cut-slots-542x564.jpg" alt="" width="542" height="564" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2186" />

<strong>Cut the slots in the ends of the drawer fronts and backs. The edges of these pieces start with a finger. Place the cut slot over the spline to cut the next slot.</strong>

Pull back the miter gauge, place the cut slot over the spline, and cut the second slot. Continue doing this until all the slots on that end are cut.

Flip the drawer front over so the edge you started cutting before is the same edge you start cutting now, and cut the slots on that end. Do the rest of the drawer fronts and backs the same way.

Do the drawer sides (F) next. Slide the first slot of a drawer front over the fence's spline. Set the edge of the drawer side against the edge of the drawer front, and cut the first slot in the drawer side (Photo 5).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/hard-maple-kitchen-shelf-05-cut-slots-564x526.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="526" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2187" />

<strong>Cut the slots in the drawer sides. Their edges start with a slot. The first finger of a drawer front is used to position the first slot of the drawer side.</strong>

Remove the drawer front, slide the drawer side over so the first slot is tight against the spline, and cut the second slot. Cut the rest of the slots as you did before, then do the rest of the drawer sides.

Remove the dado blade and mount your regular blade in your table saw.

Cut the drawer fronts, backs and sides so they're 3 in. wide; the outside fingers of the drawer fronts and backs are equal in width; and the outside slots of the drawer sides are equal in width.

You'll probably have to trim some wood off each edge.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/hard-maple-kitchen-shelf-06-cut-drawer-pieces-564x524.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="524" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2188" />

<strong>Cut the drawer pieces so they're 3 in. wide, and so the outside fingers, or slots, are the same width. You may need to trim some wood off each edge.</strong>

Now you're ready to assemble the drawers.

<h3>12. Drawer Pre-Assembly</h3>

Layout and drill the holes in the drawer fronts for the drawer pull screws.

Finish-sand the insides of the drawer sides, fronts and backs.

<h3>13. Drawer Assembly</h3>

Make the drawer clamping jig as shown in Fig. A.

Set the jig on two 1-in. tall blocks so it will be in the center of the drawer sides as you clamp the drawer pieces around the jig.

Assemble one drawer at a time. Using a small brush, apply glue to the finger joints, assemble the joints, and place the drawer over the jig.

Clamp the whole thing to the jig, but don't put the clamp heads on the protruding fingers (Photo 7)

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/hard-maple-kitchen-shelf-07-clamp-drawer-pieces-564x491.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="491" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2189" />

<strong>Clamp the drawer pieces around the drawer clamping jig. The jig ensures that each drawer is square and has the right inside dimensions.</strong>

Let the glue dry for one hour, remove the clamps and jig, and clean off any oozed glue from the inside corners with a chisel or knife.

Do the other two drawers, let the glue dry overnight, then sand down the protruding ends of the finger joints.

<h3>14. Routing The Drawer Bottom Rabbets</h3>

Rout the rabbets for the drawer bottoms (P) on the bottom edges of the drawers as shown in Photo 8.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/hard-maple-kitchen-shelf-08-rout-drawer-bottom-rabbets-564x492.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="492" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2190" />

<strong>Rout the drawer bottom rabbets in the drawers. Clamp a block of wood to the outside of the drawer to sup-port the router as you cut each edge.</strong>

<h3>15. Drawer Bottoms</h3>

Cut the round corners of the drawer bottoms so they fit in their rabbets.

Finish-sand the drawer bottoms and the outsides of the drawers. Glue and clamp the drawer bottoms in their rabbets.

<h3>16. Drawer Pulls</h3>

Cut the beveled edges of the long drawer pull piece (J), then cut the 1/16-in. reveals on the sides of that piece.

Cut piece J into 4-in. long pieces (three are for the drawer pulls; the others are spares).

Cut the beveled ends of the drawer pulls (you can do this with a file), then cut the 1/16-in. reveals on the ends of the pulls as shown in Photo 9.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/hard-maple-kitchen-shelf-09-use-fence-564x490.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="490" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2191" />

<strong>Use a fence and stop to cut the 1/16-in. reveals on the ends of the drawer pulls. A 10-degree beveled cut on the front of the fence helps hold the drawer pull.</strong>

<h3>17. Drawer Finish-Sanding</h3>

Finish-sand the drawer pulls and smooth the edges of the reveals with a file and 220-grit sandpaper.

<h3>18. Drawer Finishing</h3>

Sand smooth the sharp edges of all the parts, apply the spray finish, then attach the drawer pulls.

<h3>19. Attach The Completed Shelf To The Wall

Attach the wall cleat (G) to your wall, making sure to screw it into two studs.

If it can't be screwed to studs, use appropriate wall fasteners to handle the weight of the shelf and its contents.

Then carefully hang the shelf on the wall cleat, and you are done.

		<title>Dry Stone Retaining Wall Construction – Method, Instructions, &amp; Tips</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You don't have to be a stonemason to build a wall Fred Flintstone would be proud of.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dry-stone-retaining-wall-00-opening-564x427.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="427" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2200" />

Building a dry stone retaining wall is hard work, but it's also fun.

<h2>3 reasons why you will (also) love building a dry stone wall</h2>

<ol><li>The low-tech appeal of doing what humans have done for thousands of years;</li>
<li>The satisfaction of turning a pile of rocks into something beautiful and useful that will last for centuries;</li>
<li>The challenge of fitting together a giant, three-dimensional puzzle.</li></ol>

Whatever your specific reasons are, many people find working with stone enjoyable and satisfying.

<h2>How long will it take?</h2>

You can, of course, turn any pleasant project into drudgery by overdoing it.

Two hours of wall-building is enjoyable exercise; six hours is an ordeal.

To keep it fun, think of your wall as a summer hobby, to be plugged away at on Sunday afternoons, not a project to be completed in a weekend.

<h2>What is a "dry" stone wall?</h2>

"Dry" simply means that mortar isn't used to cement the structure together.

Rather, the stones are carefully fit into place and held there by gravity.

<h2>Mortared vs. dry stone wall: which is best?</h2>

Mixing up and slopping on mortar is, of course, a nuisance. But that's not why it is left out of this wall recipe.

A dry stone wall, put together well, will actually outlast a mortared wall for two reasons:

<ol><li>It can flex slightly, moving with the ground beneath it instead of cracking like a stiff mortared wall would; and</li>
<li>Since it doesn't rely on mortar, it won't fall apart as mortar wears away, as all mortar eventually does.</li></ol>

<h2>How long do dry stone walls last?</h2>

Some dry stone retaining walls have stood for hundreds of years, even though they were thrown up carelessly.

But building this way is a gamble. A poorly built wall may stand for decades. Then again, it may topple over next spring. Worse, it could come apart as kids play on it, resulting in broken bones.

The method shown next isn't the only way to build a dry stone wall, and it certainly isn't the easiest. But the extra effort pays off with safety and longevity.

<h2>Finding free (or cheap) rocks</h2>

Gravel pits, quarries, farms, and construction sites are good sources of low-cost or no-cost rock. But always ask before you take.

Getting rocks home is the hard part. Building a wall takes a lot of rock (this 35-ft. long, 3-ft. high wall used 10 tons to be built). So even if you have a full-size pickup truck, you'll need to make lots of trips.

For the backyard builder, rocks fall into two categories:

<ol><li><strong>angular</strong>, like shale, sandstone, marble or slate, and</li>
<li><strong>rounded</strong>, usually granite.</li></ol>

<h3>Angular rocks</h3>

Angular rocks have a definite grain, sort of like wood. So the forces of geology break them into irregular blocks with flat sides and sharp, squarish edges.

These flat surfaces make the rocks easier to fit together. They're also easier to split because they usually break along predictable lines.

<h3>Rounded rocks</h3>

Rounded rocks (like the ones we used) are much harder and have a less definite grain. They come in all shapes, but they tend to have humped surfaces. Fitting them together takes a lot more trial and error, you set one in place, find it's too wobbly and try another.

<h3>Bring your trailer!</h3>

In most regions, Mother Nature has made choosing a rock-type simple; you just take what you can get. Still, there are a few things to keep in mind while filling your truck or trailer:

<ul><li>You'll need a mix of sizes; everything from baseball-size on up. But don't play Hercules. If it's too big, leave it alone.</li>
<li>The flatter a rock's surfaces are, the better. Block-shaped rocks are valuable; round rocks are almost worthless.</li>
<li>Long rocks, which are used as "tie-stones" (Photo 4), are treasures. The more you have, the stronger your wall will be.</li>
<li>Wedge-shaped rocks are handy for "chinking" (Photo 5).</li></ul>

<h2>Shopping for rocks</h2>

If rocks are scarce in your area, or if you have no way to transport them, you can buy a load and have it dumped in your yard.

You should begin by calling a landscaping supplier. But don't just phone in an order. One advantage of buying stone is that it usually gives you a choice of types and colors. So go and browse before you buy.

Prices vary widely, depending on what you get and whom you get it from. A farmer may deliver a load of fieldstone for little more than the cost of transportation. A few tons of richly colored granite from a landscaping supplier may cost you $2,000.

<h2>Planning your dry stone wall</h2>

Establish the course of your wall by laying out a garden hose and adjusting it until you establish the path you want the wall to follow. Then cut back the slope and dig the foundation trench.

Here are a few things to keep in mind as you plan your layout:

<ul><li>If you have dirt hauled in to create or enlarge a slope, it should be thoroughly soaked a couple of times — by a garden hose or rain — so it settles before you build against it.</li>
<li>Big tree roots can slowly tear a wall apart, so you'll need to cut back any that threaten to reach your wall.</li></ul>

<h2>First, the wall foundation</h2>

Soil moves as it gets soaked and dries, freezes and thaws. A dry stone wall is flexible and will survive centuries of minor shifting. But big shifts can make it crumble in just a few years.

That's why a simple foundation and landscape fabric are good ideas. A trench lined with 3/4-in. stone provides drainage and absorbs some movement of the soil below (Photo 1).

<strong>Cut back the slope and dig a 1-ft. deep 2-ft. wide trench at its base. Keep the topsoil and subsoil separate and pile both nearby; you'll need them for backfill. Fill the trench with a 6-in. bed of 3/4-in. stone.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dry-stone-retaining-wall-02-lay-first-course-along-edge-564x486.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="486" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2202" />

<strong>Lay your first course along the outer edge of the trench. Now's the time to roll into place any rocks that are too big to lift onto upper courses.</strong>

Landscape fabric (available from landscape suppliers), placed against the backside of the wall (Photo 3), keeps soil from working its way into the wall and gradually forcing stones apart.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dry-stone-retaining-wall-03-tuck-landscape-fabric-489x564.jpg" alt="" width="489" height="564" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2203" />

<strong>Tuck landscape fabric in behind the first course, fold it over the rocks, shovel in backfill and tamp the soil down by pounding it with a post. You'll need to repeat this entire process after each course.</strong>

<h2>Setting your stones the smart way</h2>

You build a dry stone wall by repeating three steps over and over again:

<ol><li>Lay a "course" (a horizontal row of rocks);</li>
<li>backfill with subsoil you removed when you cut back the slope; and</li>
<li>"tamp" or pack down the backfill.</li></ol>

Then on to the next course. Pretty simple, but not necessarily easy.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dry-stone-retaining-wall-04-lay-fabric-back-against-slope-564x398.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="398" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2204" />

<strong>Lay the fabric back against the slope and set the next course. Each course should be wider than the previous.</strong> Note: For clarity, the photo shows three courses exposed here. You're better off completing an entire course before moving on to the next.

<h3>Tips for saving time and labor</h3>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dry-stone-retaining-wall-05-drive-chinking-stones-to-fill-gaps-531x564.jpg" alt="" width="531" height="564" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2205" />

<strong>Drive chinking stones into the wall's face to fill gaps or secure loose rocks. Wear <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/eye-protection/">safety glasses</a> to protect your eyes from shards of stone.</strong>

<ul><li>Building with stone is like putting together a jigsaw puzzle. So begin by spreading out the rocks just as you would the pieces of a puzzle.</li>
<li>Put your best, wide, flat stones aside to be used as capstones (Photo 6).</li></ul>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dry-stone-retaining-wall-06-lay-capstones-checking-with-level-564x411.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="411" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2206" />

<strong>Lay capstones, checking them with a level as you go. Capstones should bring the wall to a height roughly level with the embankment. Then tuck the fabric in behind the capstones, backfill and add topsoil.</strong>

<ul><li>Use your biggest stones for the first course. That way you won't have to heave them up into place later.</li>
<li>If, after the first course, you have a few biggies to raise onto the wall, use a wood plank to roll them up into place.</li>
<li>Fitting stones together is mostly trial and error. Cut down on both by mentally measuring the shape and size of the stone you need first. Then go hunt for the perfect fit. You may even want to use a tape measure.</li>
<li>Stone cutting is no fun. And doing it well is difficult. So we recommend you don't. But if you must, you can knock off troublesome crags or knobs with a hammer and cold chisel. <strong>If you do, wear eye protection and keep others out of the flying-stone zone!</strong></li></ul>

<h3>3 tips for the face of the wall</h3>

Carefully choose rocks for the face of the wall:

<ol><li>If you have different colors, mix them into a patchwork.</li>
<li>For a neat, geometric look, lay stones with their flat sides facing out.</li>
<li>For a rustic look, leave rounded, irregular sides exposed.</li></ol>

<h2>The 10 commandments of stonebuilding</h2>

<h3>I. Make "one over two, two over one" your wall-building motto</h3>

Lay the stones of one course over the vertical gaps between stones of the previous course; just like a bricklayer lays bricks. If you don't do this, you get "vertical run" and a weaker wall (Fig. B).

<h3>II. Use tiestones</h3>

Tiestones are long rocks laid perpendicular to the face of the wall (Photo 4).

You'll need at least one tiestone at least every 4 ft. on each course.

But you can't have too many; the more tiestones, the stronger the wall.

<h3>III. All rocks on the face of the wall must slant down toward the inside of the wall</h3>

Those that don't will eventually fall out (Fig. A).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dry-stone-retaining-wall-fig-a-dry-stone-wall-402x564.jpg" alt="" width="402" height="564" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2207" />

<strong>A dry stone retaining wall is basically an organized pile of rocks that leans against an embankment and is held together by its own weight.</strong>

<h3>IV. Keep it roughly coursed</h3>

If you're working with very irregular stone, you're likely to build jagged, uneven courses. This makes the next course harder to fit together. Soon you have no courses at all and lots of vertical run.

Try instead for roughly even courses, by avoiding peaks and filling in valleys with smaller stones (Fig. B).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dry-stone-retaining-wall-fig-b-good-wall-bad-wall-564x478.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="478" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2208" />

<strong>The left side of this wall will stand forever; the right may collapse with the next heavy rain.</strong>

<h3>V. Lay rocks flat, not on edge</h3>

This way the rocks will be more balanced (Fig. B).

VI. Use chinking

Chinking are small stone wedges driven between larger rocks, to tighten up loose-fitting rocks and fill gaps in the wall's face (Fig. A).

<h3>VII. Make it as thick as it is high</h3>

If your wall will rise 3 ft. above the ground at its base, the course under the capstones should be 3 ft. thick.

<h3>VIII. Don't build it more than 4 ft. high</h3>

The higher the wall, the more potential for injury should it collapse.

<h3>IX. Don't make the face of the wall perfectly vertical</h3>

To hold back all that earth, it must lean into the slope. A minimum of 2 in. of backward tilt for each foot of height is a good rule of thumb.

<h3>X. Mortar if you must</h3>

You should have large, tight-fitting capstones that will stay solidly in place by themselves. If not, cement them with a mortar mix like Quikrete (Fig. A).

<h2>Building a freestanding dry stone wall</h2>

A freestanding dry stone wall is similar to a retaining wall, but with a few variations. You have to be more fussy about the fit of the stones.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dry-stone-retaining-wall-freestanding-wall-512x564.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="564" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2209" />

Here are the three main principles you need to obey:

<ol><li>A retaining wall leans against a solid mound of earth. A freestanding wall leans in on itself, so the two faces must slant into each other and lock together.</li>
<li>The key to a strong freestanding wall is the "V-slant." Each course must be highest at the faces, with a gradual depression in the middle. With each stone tilting down toward the middle, gravity holds each in place and the entire wall together.</li>
<li>A freestanding dry stone wall should be as wide at its base as it is tall. Both faces should lean inward at least 2 in. for each foot of height. Amateurs shouldn't build more than 3 ft. tall.</li></ol>

		<title>How to Remove Rust from Metal</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Rust! To me, it's the ultimate eye-sore. Besides being ugly, rust weakens metal. So to make your metal railings, outdoor furniture, garden tools, and hand tools last longer, you need to do something about it — now!

The bad news about rust is that you can't ever stop it completely. Where metal, air, and moisture can be found, rust is sure to follow. The good news is, you can at least temporarily remove it and slow its return.

How you choose to remove rust often comes down to how much there is and the size and shape of the surface it's on.

Most of the products we show are available at paint stores, hardware stores, and home centers. A few of the products are a bit more specialized, but they're available on the internet.

<h2>Using Power Tools</h2>

The number-one rule of rust-busting is this: Always get rid of as much rust as you can, down to bare metal, if possible.

If you don't, you've created the perfect starting point for more rust and eventually, you'll be redoing the same area. You have better ways to use your time than to redo a project!

<h3>Removing Rust With A Cordless Drill</h3>

With decorative steel railings, where there are always bends and twists, a wire brush chucked into a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-drill-driver-kit/">cordless drill</a> is the easiest way to remove rust (Photo 1).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/getting-rid-of-rust-01-strip-away-with-wire-brush-564x504.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="504" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2215" />

<strong>Strip away rust quickly with a wire brush chucked in your electric drill. The brushes come in different wire grades (fine, medium and heavy) to match the degree of rust you're removing. We're using a medium-grade brush on our railing.</strong>

Wire brushes come in fine, medium and heavy grades. Either a fine or medium brush will work on light rust; save the heavy one for bad cases.

<h3>Removing Rust With A Sander</h3>

For de-rusting large, flat surfaces, try a power sander. A belt sander or palm sander will work, but you'll get the best results with a random orbital sander (Photo 2).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/getting-rid-of-rust-02-random-orbit-sander-for-larger-areas-564x513.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="513" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2216" />

<strong>Remove rust from larger areas with a power sander. A random orbital sander is a good choice. It works quickly and smoothly with great results. Start with a 40- to 60-grit sanding disk, depending on the degree of rust — the heavier the rust, the lower the grit number. Progress to higher numbered sanding disks (less grit) as the rust is removed, for a smooth finish.</strong>

The random sanding pattern works a large area (like the back of our metal lawn chair) and helps prevent sanding lines or gouges.

<h2>Removing Rust With Hand Tools</a>

Sometimes the old ways are the best. Scraping and sanding with a little (or a lot of) muscle power may be old-fashioned, but it works!

Photo 3 shows a variety of rust-removing products.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/getting-rid-of-rust-03-match-tool-to-project-564x352.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="352" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2217" />

<strong>Match the sanding or scraping tool to the project: A wire brush works on most surfaces; sanding cords and tapes are great for narrow gaps; steel wool and synthetic scraping pads work on all degrees of rust; sanding blocks are a good choice for flat surfaces; sanding sponges are great for sanding curves and other shapes; an English muffin is a lousy sanding tool, but a great snack!</strong>

Most of them are familiar. A couple may be new to you:

<ul><li>A wire brush loosens rust and cleans almost any metal surface.</li>
<li>Steel wool and the new synthetic scraping pads (fake steel wool) work on almost all degrees of rust.</li>
<li>Sanding blocks are great for flat surfaces. Some blocks use precut, adhesive-backed sand-paper. Others use regular sandpaper that you cut to fit and then wrap around the block.</li>
<li>A sanding sponge is flexible, so it's perfect for sanding curves and other-wise hard-to-sand shapes.</li>
<li>Sanding cords let you get into small gaps, like the kind you'll find on wrought iron railings (Photo 4). Cords come either flat or round and in different grits.</li></ul>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/getting-rid-of-rust-04-clean-out-small-gaps-471x564.jpg" alt="" width="471" height="564" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2218" />

<strong>Clean out small gaps and spaces with a sanding cord. They're available in different grits, much like conventional sand-paper. Work the cord back and forth—think of it as dental floss for metal.</strong>

<h2>How to Dissolve (or 'Convert') Rust</h2>

Trying to sand rust off some metal surfaces may be impossible — certainly a royal pain. When this happens, slip on a pair of rubber gloves and eye protection and spread on the naval jelly (Photo 5).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/getting-rid-of-rust-05-apply-naval-jelly-397x564.jpg" alt="" width="397" height="564" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2219" />

<strong>Apply naval jelly to dissolve heavy rust. Spread on a thick coating with a brush and let it work for 15 to 30 minutes. Then, rinse with water. Always wear gloves and eye protection — naval jelly contains phosphoric acid, which is caustic.</strong>

This old, reliable product dissolves rust well and is easy to use. Its gel formula keeps it in place, even on vertical surfaces. Just let it sit for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on how bad the rust is, then rinse it off with water.

An alternative to dissolving rust is to leave it in place and "convert" it. Rust converters are applied directly over the rust, and a chemical reaction seals the rust so new rust can't develop. Then, just prime and paint — pretty slick! Read the label for specific drying times before applying primer or paint.

<h2>How to Remove Rust from Hand Tools</h2>

Have you ever noticed small rust spots on the tools in your toolbox? Want to stop the dots? Line your toolbox trays with rust preventive paper (Photo 6).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/getting-rid-of-rust-06-line-toolbox-trays-564x450.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="450" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2220" />

<strong>Line your tool-box trays with rust preventive paper. This specially impregnated paper keeps moisture—and rust spots—away.</strong>

This paper is impregnated with an antioxidant that gives off vapors that keep moisture away. And no moisture means no rust No muss or fuss, and it costs super cheap.

If there's some rust on your hand tools, you can easily rub it off with steel wool. Start with a "0" or "00" grade steel wool and work up to a "000" or "0000" grade as the amount of rust decreases.

If you own a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-dremel-rotary-tool/">rotary grinding tool, such as a Dremel</a>, you have one of the best power tools available for getting rid of rust. The small grinding, wire brush, and sanding heads let you work in tight places with great precision.

If you own a bench grinder, use a wire wheel to brush away rust from tools and other objects. Wire wheels come in fine to coarse grades. Always wear <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/eye-protection/">eye protection</a>.

<h2>Anticorrosion Primers and Paints</h2>

You must apply primer to bare metal within 24 hours or rust will again begin to form. If it does, you'll need to start all over again.

If there's some rust left on what you're painting and you didn't use a converter, use a "direct-to-rust" primer/coating (Photo 7).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/getting-rid-of-rust-07-apply-direct-to-rust-primer-564x429.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="429" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2221" />

<strong>Apply "direct-to-rust" primer if there's still some rust on the metal. These primers bond to the rust and encapsulate it, preventing it from spreading, and they prime the metal — all in one step.</strong>

These products bond to existing rust and prevent it from spreading, much like a converter.

Work in a well-ventilated area and wear a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/respirators/">respirator</a> as well.

Whether to spray or brush on the primer and paint depends on what you're painting. Spray paint works best on intricate designs, such as stair railings. Brush-applied primer and paint work well for large, flat areas, such as metal storage sheds.

Be sure the primer and paint can be used on metal. Any brand-name paint will work (Photo 8), so it's your choice, but try to stay with the same brand of primer and paint because they're formulated to work together.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/getting-rid-of-rust-08-primer-and-paint-564x412.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="412" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2222" />

<strong>Primer and paint come in both spray and brush-applied formulas. Choose the application method that's best for your project. Also, use a primer and paint from the same manufacturer since they're formulated to work together.</strong>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Kick back and relax with this fun-to-build weekend project.

The smooth, gentle glide of this porch swing will keep you daydreaming for hours. In fact, you may lose your ambition for good!

The swing's simple cuts and no-hassle glue and screw assembly techniques make it a great first-time woodworking project. <strong>You can build it in a weekend.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/porch-swing-00-opening-564x443.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="443" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2229" />

<h2>Construction Overview</h2>

The swing was designed with a unique suspension system made from ordinary 1/2-in. black steel pipe (commonly used for gas piping) slipped through the swing frame to act as a cradle and eliminate stress on wood joints.

Eye bolts are then fastened through the steel pipe and covered by soft rubber caps to prevent scrapes.

The swing assembly is then supported with welded steel chain, securely fastened to solid framing in the porch roof.

<h2>What Tools Will You Need?</h2>

The only special tools needed are a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/table-saw-jigs-instructions/">table saw</a> and a <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/best-drill-bit-set/">pilot hole/countersink combination bit</a>.

While your work ethic is still intact, round up the following tools:

<ul><li><a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-circular-saw/">circular saw</a>,</li>
<li><a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/cordless-drill-driver-kit/">drill</a> with bits and screwdriver attachment,</li>
<li><a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/how-to-use-a-jigsaw/">jigsaw</a>,</li>
<li>tape measure,</li>
<li><a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/how-to-use-square/">square</a>,</li>
<li>pencil,</li>
<li><a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/random-orbit-sander/">sander,</li>
<li>hacksaw, and</li>
<li>adjustable wrench.</li><ul>

You'll also need access to a table saw.

If you're a first-timer, be aware that you'll need to predrill holes for every screw so you won't split the wood or bust the screw shaft.

To make this process easier, buy a special combination bit that can do both in one operation and has a driver on the opposite end.

<h2>Choosing Materials</h2>

Pick knot-free boards. Knots can weaken a board and spell disaster, especially on furniture.

Also, stay away from cedar, redwood and soft pine for this project. They'll mar easily and won't hold screws as well as other, denser woods.

Excellent choices are fir, Southern yellow pine, cypress, poplar, white oak and maple. Oak and maple are harder to cut, sand, drill, and screw, so if you're a first-timer, avoid them.

This project uses poplar because it's strong, readily available, easy to work and takes paint well.

<h2>Measure each piece carefully</h2>

Cut all the parts to the dimensions in the Cutting List. Using a table saw, make 1x3s from your 1x6s (see Cutting List). Then notch the front arm supports as shown in Fig. A.

Draw the curved shapes (parts A and P) onto hardboard as shown in Photo 2 and trace them onto boards, or simply draw the 1-in. square grids directly onto the pieces.

Cut them out with your jigsaw and sand the curves smooth with 100-grit sandpaper. Drill 7/8-in. diameter holes with a sharp spade bit into parts A for the front pipe hanger.

Cut the center and top horizontal back braces (parts F and G) from 1x4s as shown in Photo 1.

<strong>Set your saw at 27-1/2 degrees and rip the pieces that make the center and top back supports. If you don't have a table saw, ask the lumber-yard or a well-equipped neighbor to help.</strong>

<strong>Clamp the seat support parts to the workbench to keep them from wandering while you cut the curves. Follow the pattern in Fig. A to accurately copy the curves for the seat frames as well as the arms. Sand along the curves after cutting.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/porch-swing-03-notch-front-arm-supports-564x531.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="531" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2232" />

<strong>Notch the front arm supports with a jigsaw to accept the front stringer (C). Drill pilot and countersink holes and apply a dab of construction adhesive at each joint. Fasten with 1-5/8 in. deck screws.</strong>

<h3>Why construction adhesive?</h3>

Buy a small tube of construction adhesive for this outdoor project. Liquid Nails brand LN-600 was chosen because it's waterproof and resilient.

Construction adhesive will help your porch swing stand up to both weather and stress.

The small tube shown is the same stuff as in the larger "caulk-gun" sized tubes but is less cumbersome for a smaller project like the swing.

Apply a small bead at every joint. If the glue oozes slightly, let the excess harden and then scrape it off with a sharp putty knife or <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/how-to-use-a-wood-chisel-safely/">wood chisel</a>.

<h2>Assemble the swing on a temporary workbench</h2>

Create a large work surface by laying a sheet of plywood across sawhorses (Photo 7).

Glue and screw the front stringer (C) to the front arm braces (B). Next, fasten this assembly to the seat braces (A1 and A2) and rear stringer (D) to complete the seat frame assembly (Photo 4).

Drill through the front arm braces (B) with your 7/8-in. drill bit after you've glued and screwed the side seat braces to them (Photo 4).

These two holes will complete the pathway for the front pipe support (Q).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/porch-swing-04-notch-the-angle-564x561.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="561" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2233" />

<strong>Trace the angle of the center seat brace (A2) onto each side brace to get the proper positioning of the rear stringer (D) fastening points. Again, drill pilot holes and glue and screw the seat braces to the front stringer and the front arm braces.</strong>

Next, glue and screw the rear stringer to the seat braces. After you assemble the arm braces, stringers and seat braces, glue and screw the curved front arm supports (L) to the sides of B as shown in Fig. A.

Assemble the back as shown in Fig. A and Photo 5.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/porch-swing-05-lay-back-slats-face-down-507x564.jpg" alt="" width="507" height="564" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2234" />

<strong>Lay all the back slats face down on a flat surface and slip temporary 1/4-in. spacers between the slats. Fasten the bottom brace (El to the middle slat, using a framing square to make sure they're joined at 90 degrees.</strong>

Cut 1/4-in. spacers from scrap wood (1/4-in. plywood pieces are perfect) to help maintain consistent spacing. Start at the center and work out to the sides. When you get to the fourth slat on each side, check your spacing; you may need to adjust it so the outer edge of the tapered slat (K) is flush with the end of the lower back brace (E).

Now it's time to cut the curves on the back assembly. Make a simple beam compass from a scrap of wood as shown in Photo 8.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/porch-swing-06-trace-top-curves-on-front-side-564x530.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="530" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2235" />

<strong>Trace the top curves on the front side of the back assembly using a simple homemade beam compass. Nail one end of the compass 14 in. from the top and in the center of the 1x6 back slat. Insert your pencil into the 1/4-in. hole drilled in the other end of the compass. Cut along the mark with your jigsaw.</strong>

Flip the backrest assembly over, use your beam compass to mark the curves and cut along the mark with a jig-saw. With the backrest assembly in this position, measure and mark a 2-1 /2 in. line parallel to the bottom edge (Photo 7). Grab the seat frame assembly you built earlier and finesse it onto the backrest assembly (Photo 7).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/porch-swing-07-hang-lower-part-of-back-assembly-496x564.jpg" alt="" width="496" height="564" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2236" />

<strong>Hang the lower part of the back assembly over the edge of the work surface to make room as you slide the seat assembly onto it. Align the rear stringer of the seat assembly with a mark drawn 2-1/2 in. from the bottom of the back assembly. Glue the joint, then clamp and screw the assemblies together.</strong>

It's crucial to align the rear seat frame stringer (D) to the 2-1/2 in. line on the backrest so the rest of the assembly will fit together.

Drill 7/8-in. holes in the horizontal arm supports (M) to the exact dimensions shown in Fig. A. Then glue and screw these pieces to the front arm braces (B) and the center back brace (F; Photo 8).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/porch-swing-08-cut-and-drill-pipes-544x564.jpg" alt="" width="544" height="564" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2237" />

<strong>Cut and drill the pipes (Fig. A) and slide them into the holes. File the inside of the 7/8-in. hole in the arm support (M) with a coarse half-round file if the support pipe won't easily slide through. The rear support pipe should fit snugly under the center back brace (F) as it protrudes through each arm support.</strong>

Next, glue and screw the seat slats to the seat braces. Start in the back and leave approximately a 3/16-in. space between each piece.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/porch-swing-09-drill-3-16-hole-in-center-of-rear-support-pipe-564x401.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="401" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2238" />

<strong>Drill a 3/16-in. hole in the center of the rear support pipe, then screw a 2-in. No. 8 sheet metal screw (use a 1/8-in. pilot hole) up into the center back support. This connection will keep the pipe from sliding to one side while the swing is swinging.</strong>

Trim the last slat to overhang the front stringer 1/2 in. Plane the transition piece on the curve of the seat (Photo 10) and at the leading edge of the front seat slat for maximum comfort.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/porch-swing-10-shave-off-high-spots-with-block-plane-558x564.jpg" alt="" width="558" height="564" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2239" />

<strong>Shave off any high spots with a block plane. Because the seat is curved, the slat edges can ride high at certain points, making for a less-than-comfortable ride later.

<h2>Don't skimp on the hardware</h2>

Buy oversize (3/16-in. or 1/4-in. thick) chain with welded links for good looks and safety. Also buy 1/4-in. threaded eyebolts along with thread-locking compound to keep the nuts from working loose. The quick-link eyes (Photo 11) are indispensable for linking chain quickly. Buy your black pipe at a hardware store and have it cut to exact lengths without threaded ends.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/porch-swing-11-hang-swing-securely-564x475.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="475" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2240" />

<strong>Hang the swing securely using special quick-link eyes to join the lengths of chain. The swing should tip back slightly at the arms (about 1 in. from back to front) when the swing is at rest.</strong>

Now, test-fit the pipe, chain and connecting links to the wooden assembly (Fig. A). It's a good time to discover any glitches and correct them before you paint. Slide the pipes through the holes in the seat frame and along the back, leaving an equal amount exposed on each side.

Mark the hole locations in the pipes to lock them to the swing (Photo 9 and Fig. A). Drill 3/16-in. diameter holes for the sheet metal lockscrews and 9/32-in. diameter screws for the eye bolts. Angle the eye bolts slightly toward the center of the swing to minimize the torque on the pipe and prevent the lock-screws from breaking.

Remember, this swing could be holding 400 lbs. or more, so you must anchor the swing's chain with 1/2-in.-shaft screw eyes screwed at least 2 in. into solid framing as shown in Fig. C.

<h3>Fig. C: Hanging Detail</h3>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/porch-swing-fig-c-hanging-detail-564x279.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="279" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2243" />

<strong>Screw a length of 2x4 into solid framing to support each chain. Be sure to use 4-in. long lag screws and span at least three ceiling joists.</strong>

Also, distribute the weight to more than one ceiling joist by screwing a pair of 2x4s 54 in. apart and then inserting the screw eyes into the 2x4s.

<h2>Ease the wood edges with sandpaper before you paint</h2>

Remove the chains and pipes to paint the wood assembly. Sand the pipes with 100-grit sandpaper, then wipe them down with a rag dampened with mineral spirits. Let the mineral spirits evaporate off the surfaces, then spray-paint the pipes with exterior primer followed by an exterior enamel.

Sand the wood parts with 100-grit sandpaper, paying particular attention to the arms and the edges of the seat and back. Softer edges will be safer and more comfortable and hold paint better.

Wipe off the dust and vacuum the swing. You'll make better time if you roll (use a small 4-in. roller) on a good-quality primer and follow it up with a brush to even the coat.

Use the brush to paint between the slats and then look for runs and drips coming through the other side.

Use an oil-based primer (or water-based if you prefer), then lightly sand the swing the next day with 150-grit sandpaper.

Choose the best polyurethane exterior paint you can find and apply it using the same roller and brush technique. Let the paint cure for a couple of days before you rehang the swing.

<strong>Note</strong>: During the final assembly, squirt thread-locking compound on the eye bolt threads. Be sure to cut the eye bolts flush with the nuts for safety.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>How to Use a Biscuit Joiner to Make Cabinets</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Complex <a href="http://bestlife52.com/site-map/#Free_Woodworking_Plans_Projects_Ideas">woodworking projects</a> — even some simple ones — used to scare me away. I just didn't have the patience, skills, or equipment needed to make strong, accurate joints. Then I discovered a clever little tool biscuit joiner. You use this tool to cut half-moon slots in the adjacent pieces of a joint, then you spread glue in the slots and join the pieces with store-bought flat discs called "biscuits" The biscuits swell when they contact the glue, locking the joint firmly together.

Creating biscuit joints is easier than doweling and quicker than dadoing, and the results are stronger than nailing. You can make face frame cabinets, bookshelves (like we did), join mitered corners for picture frames, assemble deck railings, and join boards together, side by side and end for end, for furniture projects. You can use biscuits to join solid wood, plywood, and even particleboard.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/biscuit-joiner-01-every-joint-held-with-biscuits-and-glue.jpg" alt="" width="726" height="505" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2292" />

<strong>Every joint in this bookshelf is held together with only biscuits and glue.</strong>

There are differences in how biscuit joiners are adjusted, and some can cut smaller slots for smaller-scale projects, but all the models perform the single basic function of cutting slots for the biscuits. There are three standard biscuit sizes — 0, 10, and 20 — with "0" being the smallest.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/biscuit-joiner-02-parts-explained.jpg" alt="" width="749" height="514" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2293" />

<strong>Biscuit joiners operate by cutting small half-moon slots in boards that are then joined using biscuits and glue. The tool can be adjusted to accommodate different-size biscuits, wood thicknesses and angles.</strong>

A basic biscuit joiner plus biscuits cost a darn reasonable price for equipment that can make or break your decision to enter the world of furniture building or cabinetmaking.

<h2>Biscuit Joint Basics</h2>

There are four basic steps to making a strong biscuit joint:

<h3>1. Lay out the slots</h3>

Position the boards exactly how they'll be joined, then use a square and pencil to mark the biscuit positions. The joiner has an alignment indicator mark (Photo 3) that lines up with these pencil lay-out lines.

When possible, keep the slots at least 2-1/2 in. away from the ends of the boards, and equally spaced 6 to 8 in. along their length.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/biscuit-joiner-03-line-up-slot-indicator.jpg" alt="" width="597" height="525" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2294" />

<strong>Line up the slot indicator mark on the tool with the layout mark on the board, then push the tool firmly into the board to create the biscuit slot.</strong>

<h3>2. Adjust the angle and depth of the slot</h3>

All joiners have a knob that adjusts the plunge depth of the cutter for the size biscuit being used (Photo 2). Dial in the size biscuit you'll be using and the depth of cut is automatically set.

The tool has an angle scale on the side of the fence that indicates what angle the slot will be in relation to the surface the tool is resting on. Most of the time it will be a 0- or 90-degree angle, but the fence is adjustable to cut slots for any size angle in between.

You also need to adjust the fence up or down to position the slot along the thickness of the board. Keep the slot a minimum of 1/4 in. away from the surface of the board.

The biscuit expands as it soaks up the glue, and if it's too close to the surface, it will cause a bulge. In most cases, you'll center the slot on the thickness of the board.

<h3>3. Cut the slots</h3>

Clamp the workpiece to your workbench, then line up the indicator mark on the tool with the layout line on the workpiece.

Keep the fence flat on the board, press the On switch and slowly push the joiner against the wood until the joiner stops, then retract the tool.

Blow and tap any loose wood shavings out of the slot.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/biscuit-joiner-04-cut-slots.jpg" alt="" width="599" height="441" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2295" />

<strong>Cut the slots at least 2-1/2 in. from the end of the board, and equally spaced every 6 to 8 in. along its length for maximum strength.</strong>

<h3>4. Glue and clamp the boards</h3>

Dry-fit the boards and biscuits to make sure the slots and joints line up.

Fill the slots with carpenter's glue, using a special glue container with a long, flattened snout to get the glue into and along the sides of the slots.

[table id=11 /]

If the joint is part of an outdoor project, use an exterior-grade carpenter's glue.

Press the biscuit into one slot (Photo 5), apply glue to the rest of the surfaces being joined, then clamp the joints together for at least 20 minutes. Remove excess glue with a damp rag.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/biscuit-joiner-05-spread-glue.jpg" alt="" width="586" height="479" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2296" />

<strong>Spread the glue into the slots so the biscuit will be completely coated when it's put in place. Apply glue along the edges to be joined, then clamp the boards together.</strong>

<h2>5 Easy-to-Make Joints</h2>

Practice cutting slots on scrap pieces of wood before cutting the slots on your real project. Once you get a feel for the tool, you can easily create the joints shown in Photo 1:

<h3>Edge-to-edge joints</h3>

Use biscuits when edge-gluing to both strengthen a joint and help align the board surfaces (Photo 5). Place glue along the entire edge of the joint for a strong bond.

The boards should be at least 1/2 in. thick to ensure that the biscuits don't create surface bulges. On boards more than 1 in. thick, you can cut two pockets, one from each face of the board, and use two biscuits for extra strength.

Lay out the biscuit slots so they won't be exposed when the board is cut to finished size.

<h3>Corner butt joints</h3>

After clamping a support board on the workpiece (Photo 6), adjust the front fence so it's perpendicular to the surface being prepared.

Lay the joiner on the work-piece and line up the indicator mark with the layout line.

Use both hands on the tool to keep it steady while cutting the slot.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/biscuit-joiner-06-use-support-board.jpg" alt="" width="603" height="415" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2297" />

<strong>Use a support board to create a wider surface to guide the fence while cutting slots for a butt joint.</strong>

<h3>T-joint</h3>

A biscuit joint can take the place of a dado when you're building fixed shelves (Photo 7).

Mark layout lines on the workpiece to show where the matching board will join, then clamp a temporary wood fence on the board so the joiner will cut the slots at the proper offset and the joint will match up.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/biscuit-joiner-07-clamp-wood-fence.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="568" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2298" />

<strong>Clamp a wood fence to the workpiece to guide the biscuit joiner's fence when you're making T-joints or other mid-board connections.</strong>

<h3>Face frame construction</h3>

Joining a rail and stile of a face frame (Photo 3) with biscuits used to be troublesome if the rail was less than 2 in. wide. The biscuit slot would be large enough that it would show after the pieces were assembled (the slot for a "0" biscuit is wider than a standard 1-1/2 in. stile).

But joiners are now available that can cut slots for mini biscuits. Depending on the size of your projects, you may want to consider a model that can cut these mini biscuits.

Porter Cable and Ryobi are just two companies that market mini biscuit models or accessories.

<h3>Face frame assembly to the box</h3>

Using biscuits to join a face frame to a cabinet box (Photo 8) not only creates an indestructible joint but eliminates the need for unsightly nails and screws.

Clamp the face frame to the box in the position it will be assembled.

Mark the corresponding layout marks on the face frame and box with a square.

Cut the slots, dry-fit the pieces, then glue and clamp the pieces until the glue is set up.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/biscuit-joiner-08-dry-fit-all-parts-with-biscuits.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="468" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2299" />

<strong>Dry-fit all joints with the biscuits in place to ensure a good fit. Then glue and clamp the pieces together.</strong>

<h2>Biscuit Joiner Safety & Maintenance</h2>

In theory, the cutter is safely retracted when not in use and safely buried in the wood when in use. Still, the tool requires caution.

Wear <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/eye-protection/">safety glasses</a> and <a href="http://bestlife52.com/home-improvement/hearing-protection/">hearing protection</a>, and keep hands and loose clothing away from the front of the tool while cutting.

Maintenance is simple; you just replace the cutter when it becomes dull. Most cutters will give you years of work (unless you join a lot of particleboard).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ever wonder how a trim carpenter makes window and door trim and baseboards fit so perfectly? OK, so they probably have years of experience. But they also used the right tool — a miter saw. Since its introduction in 1967, the miter saw (also called chop saw) has become a must-have tool for trim carpenters and thousands of do-it-yourselfers.

<h2>What does a miter saw do best?</h2>

Here are the main advantages of a power miter saw:

<h3>1. Precise Angles</h3>

Once you set any type of miter or angled cuts, they will be accurate and remain so for as many cuts as you wish. 45-degree miter cuts are even better because of the positive stops built in most saws.

<strong>Miter joints will be perfect because the saw has built-in stops at 45 degrees for both left- and right-hand cuts.</strong>

<h3>2. Square End Cuts</h3>

When you use a miter saw and properly support your workpiece on both sides of the cut, you ensure perfect 90-degree cuts in both directions.

<h3>3. Exact Length</h3>

Cutting exactly on the cutting line is fast and easy because you can nibble off thin slices of material until you're on the line (Photo 2).

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/miter-saw-02-nibble-cut-up-to-cut-line.jpg" alt="" width="596" height="563" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2308" />

<strong>Nibble cut up to the cutting line. Don't try to cut right on the line the first time. You can remove less than the kerf (thickness) of the saw blade by moving the material.</strong>

<h3>4. Cutting Thick Lumber</h3>

A power miter saw can cut completely through a 4x4 post in one pass. A 7-1/4 in. circular saw (the most popular size) can't do that.

<h3>5. Cutting Other Materials</h3>

With a carbide blade, you can also cut aluminum shower door tracks, suspended ceiling gridwork, and other aluminum materials. Plastic plumbing pipe too. What a versatile tool!

<h2>Miter Saw Limitations</h2>

The biggest drawback of a miter saw is that the smaller (and cheaper) sizes can't cut completely through wide material, such as 2x10 or 2x12 boards, in one pass.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/miter-saw-06-cut-wider-lumber-with-sliding-miter-saws.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="556" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2312" />

Well, a sliding miter saw can make these cuts, but you'll spend twice as much for one.

<h2>Miter Saw Shopping Tips</h2>

Here are the main aspects to watch out for when choosing a saw:

<ul><li>Ten-inch models give you the most saw for your money. They can cut 4x4s and 2x6s at 90 degrees and 2x4s at 45 degrees.</li>
<li>Compound miter saws will make those tricky two-angles-at-once (vertical and horizontal) cuts for crown molding. Compound miter saws cost 25 to 30% more than regular miter saws.</li>
<li>Lift the saw. This is a portable power tool and you'll want it near your work site. Make sure you can lift it without too much strain.</li>
<li>Be sure it comes with a dust bag, since you'll be using it indoors.</li>
<li>See that the blade guard works easily and doesn't obstruct your view when you're cutting. Some guards work better than others. If you don't like the way it works, check out a different saw.</li>
<li>Buy a carbide blade. Most saws come with a steel blade that's OK for cutting framing lumber, but not trim. A 50- to 80-tooth carbide blade will make smooth trim cuts.</li>
<li>If you want extra cutting capacity, consider a sliding miter saw. They come in sizes from 8-1/4 to 12 in.</li></ul>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/miter-saw-03-increase-width-capacity-place-scrap-piece-under.jpg" alt="" width="597" height="529" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2309" />

<strong>Increase the width capacity of your saw by placing a scrap piece of 3/4-in. mated-al under the wood. This technique enabled our 10-in. saw to cut completely through a 2x8.</strong>

<h2>How to Use a Miter Saw Safely</h2>

Here are a few tips to help you get the most out of your power miter saw:

<ul><li><strong>SAFETY FIRST!</strong> Never remove or alter the blade guard.</li>
<li><strong>Support long pieces</strong>. If the material sags, your cut won't be square. Build T-block supports from scrap lumber (Photo 4).</li></ul>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/miter-saw-04-support-long-pieces-of-material.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="608" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2310" />

<strong>Support long pieces of material. T-blocks, built from scrap wood, work great. The blocks must be the same height as the saw's table. Remember, if the wood isn't lying flat, the cut won't be square.</strong>

<ul><li><strong>Getting clean cuts</strong>. Wait for the blade to go through the wood and keep the blade down until it stops. Lifting the saw while the blade is spinning will tear up the grain near the cut. Most saws have a blade brake that stops the blade within a few seconds.</li>
<li><strong>If you're making repetitive cuts and using a stop-block jig (Photo 5), the saw must be clamped or bolted down. If it's not, the saw will move, making the jig worthless.</li></ul>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/miter-saw-05-use-stop-block-for-repetitive-cuts.jpg" alt="" width="613" height="646" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2311" />

<strong>Repetitive cuts are easy and accurate when you use a stop-block jig. Secure the jig to the work surface with clamps or screws. Our jig is set up for cutting stair rail spindles all the same length.</strong>

<ul><li><strong>Crown molding miters</strong> are cut with the material held upside down and backwards when you use a standard, non-com-pound miter saw. Think of the table of the miter box as the room's ceiling and the fence as the room's wall. With a compound saw, you can lay the molding flat on the saw's cutting table.</li>
<li><strong>You can't rip boards</strong> (cut them lengthwise) with a power miter saw. Use a circular saw with a guide, a table saw or a radial arm saw.</li></ul>

<h2>Other Miter Saw Tips</h2>

<h3>Chop Saw Support Blocks</h3>

Miter saw or chop saw, whatever you call it, it's the one power tool you don't want to be without. Suppose you only have a few cuts to make and need a temporary support for your work.

Keep a couple of outrigger supports handy. Build them the same height as your miter saw table, and you'll no longer have to ask your spouse to act as a chop saw support table.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/miter-saw-tip-01-chop-saw-support-blocks.jpg" alt="" width="677" height="650" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2313" />

<strong>Screw an 18-in. block to an 18-in. long by 6-in. wide scrap of plywood. The total thickness of the plywood and block should add up to the height of your chop saw table.</strong>

<h3>Portable Chop Saw Table</h3>

In just 10 minutes, you can make a portable saw table that supports long stock and makes quick work of multiple identical cuts.

Use the predrilled holes in your chop saw's feet to fasten it to the table so you can pick up the whole rig and throw it in the back of the pickup or station wagon for road trips.

Most cuts are made on the right side of the work, so I prefer to go without right side supports. But you may decide to center the saw in the middle of the table and put supports on each side.

Table length is also up to you. I usually make mine just under 8 ft. so it'll fit in the truck.

If you want to really go wild, modify this design slightly and make a permanent lightweight table out of 3/8-in. plywood. Build cubbyholes for your doohickeys and use mounting bolts with Wing-Nuts for easy removal of the chop saw.

<strong>(PHOTO BELOW) Screw blocks to a 2x12 with 3-in. screws, and screw a 2x6 on top of the blocks. Rip the blocks so that the top of the 2x6 exactly matches the height of the chop saw table.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/miter-saw-tip-02-portable-chop-saw-table.jpg" alt="" width="775" height="831" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2314" />

<strong>(DETAIL ABOVE) Screw a stop block to the table for cutting multiple pieces of the same length. Cut a 45-degree chamfer on the bottom edge of the block so sawdust won't pile up against it and prevent your work-piece from reaching the stop.</strong>

<h3>Miter Saw Quick (and Important) Safety Tip</h3>

Whenever you use a miter saw, hold the work firmly against the fence (the vertical back). If you don't, the saw blade can seize in the wood, toss it and cause a serious injury.

<h3>Miter saw tuneup</h3>

If your miter saw isn't cutting square, the problem is easy to fix.

Unplug the saw, loosen the fence bolts, and hold a framing square against the fence and blade. Be sure the square touches only the saw's plate and not the carbide teeth so you can make an accurate adjustment.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/miter-saw-tip-03-tuneup.jpg" alt="" width="730" height="571" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2315" />

With the blade down as deep as it will go in the throat plate, slide the .002-in. thick blade of an automotive feeler gauge (super cheap at auto parts stores) between the blade and the square. Adjust the fence until you feel uniform resistance all along the frame and blade, then retighten the bolts.

Check a few test cuts for square, and you're done.

<h3>Quick and Accurate Miter Saw Cuts</h3>

If your miter saw has a removable throat plate, you can customize your saw with a "zero-clearance" throat plate that makes it easy to line up the cut.

With this tip, you'll be able to line up crosscuts faster and cut boards with less tear-out.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/miter-saw-tip-04-zero-clearance-throat-plate.jpg" alt="" width="1015" height="543" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2316" />

<strong>Here's how</strong>: Remove the original throat plate, and cut a plywood piece to the thickness and width of the saw's original throat plate. They're easy to make, so cut a few extras.

Mark, drill and countersink any screw holes and install the wood throat plate. Now cut into the new wood throat plate with your miter saw blade to create a zero-clearance opening.

To use, mark the cuts along the board edge, line 'em up with one edge of the zero-clearance opening, and make perfect cuts every time.

<h3>A long (and portable) miter-saw table</h3>

An extension ladder on a pair of sawhorses makes the perfect stable and fiat miter saw table, especially for cutting long stuff. Mount the saw on a plywood base, clamp it to the ladder, add a couple of outfeed supports and you're ready to cut away!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Buying a table saw used to mean shelling out a pile of cash for a big, heavy machine and then carving out a more or less permanent space for it in your garage or basement.

Now there's a new breed of table saw that's light, portable and less than half the cost of its big cousins. These "benchtop" saws are small enough to store on a shelf, light enough to toss in your trunk and powerful enough for everyday cutting tasks, but they do have limitations.

<h2>Benchtop Table Saw Buying Guide</h2>

I'll help you decide if a benchtop table saw is right for you, then show you what features to look for and how to compare saws and choose the one that's best for you.

<h3>No saw is perfect, so look for one with the features you need</h3>

A benchtop table saw is ideal for ripping (cutting a board lengthwise to make it narrower), but cutting down large sheets of plywood or cutting long boards to length is a different story. These tasks are difficult to accomplish on any table saw but almost impossible on a bench-top saw.

There are at least 15 different models of benchtop table saws on the market, and none of them is perfect for every person. In general, the more you spend, the better the features.

<h3>Narrow the field by deciding how much to spend</h3>

I list most of the available saws below.

The saws on the low end of the scale are generally lightweight. They also tend to have less durable motors and less accurate fences and controls than more expensive saws, but they'll work fine for light-duty work and cutting thin wood (less than 1 in. thick) for birdhouses and craft projects.

In the middle of the price range are benchtop saws used by many professional carpenters. That's because these saws are powerful enough to rip through 2x4s day after day but still compact and light enough to be easily thrown in the back of the truck.

There are only a few saws in the higher price range. They offer better fences and features not found on less expensive saws, but you'll pay for these in extra size and weight.

<h3>Most motors have plenty of power, but some run smoother and last longer</h3>

Saws that cost more generally have better-quality motors that last longer and run smoother. Some even have brakes built in to stop the blade fast when you're done cutting.

There are a couple of things you can do to help your saw cut faster and last longer. If you bought a saw with a 10-in. blade that bogs down when you rip 2x4s, try installing a thinner 8-1/4 in. blade instead.

Also, check out the manual that came with the saw for extension cord requirements. In general, the shorter and heavier gauge the cord, the better your saw will run and the longer the motor will last.

<h3>How is the Motor Mounted?</h3>

<strong>Look under the saw to see how the motor is mounted; stronger is better.</strong>

A benchtop table saw is little more than a hand-held circular saw mounted upside down under a table. Better saws have cast aluminum motor mounts that are more rigid than the stamped steel mounts found on less expensive saws (Photo 1), and this translates to less blade deflection for smoother, straighter saw cuts.

Compare motor mount mechanisms by tilting the saw back and taking a close, hands-on look at the underside. You don't have to be a mechanical engineer to see the difference in quality.

Keep in mind that almost every cut you make will require adjusting the motor and blade position. These parts get a lot of wear and tear and are directly responsible for the quality of the cut.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-01-tilt-saw-back.jpg" alt="" width="638" height="799" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2323" />

<strong>Tilt the saw back and take a close look at the bracket that supports the motor. This saw has a cast aluminum motor mount bracket and precision gearing that moves the motor up and down steel shafts.</strong>

<h3>How Solid is the Miter Gauge?</h3>

<strong>Look for a saw with a solid miter gauge for accurate miters and crosscuts</strong>

Crosscutting isn't a table saw's best feature no matter what the price, but if you intend to use a table saw for precise angle cuts, the miter gauge should have adjustable stops at 90 and 45 degrees and fit snugly in the table top groove (Photo 2).

Slide the gauge along the slot. It should move easily with no side-to-side play. The Delta saw shown has a T-slot to keep the gauge from falling out when it's pulled beyond the edge of the table. A full-size 3/4-in. wide x 3/8-in. deep slot, the standard size for contractor and cabinet table saws, is essential if you want to use cabinetmaking accessories like a tenoning jig.

(By the way, if you own a power miter box for making crosscuts and miters, then having a good miter gauge isn't as important.)

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-02-slide-miter-gauge.jpg" alt="" width="627" height="733" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2324" />

<strong>Slide the miter gauge on this Delta saw back toward you and you'll see the benefit of the T-slot that keeps the gauge from falling out. Adjust the stop screws for precise 90-degree and 45-degree cuts by screwing them in or out. The 3/4-in. wide slot accepts standard accessories.</strong>

<h3>Are the cranks smooth? Is the switch safe?</h3>

Nothing's more frustrating on these little saws than cranks that are hard to turn, levers that knock your knuckles or switches that you have to grope for.

Crank the blade up and down. You'll want a saw that moves smoothly and is easy to crank. Now try tilting the blade. On most saws, this is accomplished by flipping the lever behind the crank to loosen the motor and then pushing the lever to tilt the blade. It's hard to get a precise bevel setting with this system. Makita solved this problem by adding a wheel that you turn to adjust the angle (Photo 3).

Saws with better-quality motor mount mechanisms are the ones that adjust easily and smoothly.

Try out the switch. To deter inquisitive children, the best switches are a little tricky to turn on. For additional protection against unauthorized use, most switches can be locked. For example, pulling out a plastic pin on the Makita disables the switch (Photo 3), which is great (if you don't lose the pin!). Some saws require you to provide a small padlock or similar locking device.

For safety, the best switches can be turned off with a quick swat. In an emergency, you'll want to be able to stop the saw instinctively, without having to look for the switch or grope to find it.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-03-turn-crank-lower-blade.jpg" alt="" width="618" height="666" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2325" />

<strong>Turn the crank to raise and lower the blade. Look for smooth, easy operation. Unlike most saws, this saw also has a knob that tilts the blade. The large orange switch requires a special procedure to turn on, but turns off with a quick swat. Remove the black button to lock the switch.</strong>

<h3>What about dust collection?</h3>

<strong>Look for a table saw with a dust collection port.</strong>

Many of the table saws have a port to attach a shop vacuum hose (Photo 4). This is a handy feature if you're working inside and want to catch at least some of the dust before it spreads.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-04-hook-up-vacuum.jpg" alt="" width="647" height="433" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2326" />

<strong>Hook up a vacuum to the back of the saw to collect dust. Some saws have a built-in dust collection port that allows you to connect a shop vacuum. This is a big plus if you're sawing indoors.</strong>

<h3>Take a Good Look at the Table Saw Fence</h3>

<strong>Look for a smooth-adjusting fence with an accurate lock-down.</strong>

A table saw without a good fence is like a drill without bits.

You'll be adjusting and locking down the fence for almost every cut you make, and a crummy fence will try your patience and can be dangerous.

You'll be able to tell a lot about the quality of the fence by sliding it along the table and locking it in place. Better fences slide easily and lock down solidly.

You can test how good a table saw fence is by grabbing the end of the fence farthest from the front of the saw and try to move it back and forth. It should stay put.

<ul><li>DeWalt has done a great job of designing a fence that adjusts easily, stays parallel to the blade and locks down tight, but you'll pay dearly for this saw.</li>
<li>Fences on the mid-priced saws lock down firmly but usually require you to align the fence with the saw blade every time you change the ripping width.</li>
<li>Some less expensive saws have flimsy fences that won't stay put. </li></ul>

Besides giving you a bad cut, a fence that slips or moves while you're ripping can cause the board to bind and kick back, presenting a serious safety hazard.

If you think you'll use your table saw to rip plywood for shelves or cabinets, check out the maximum ripping width. This is determined by how far the fence can be set from the blade. The range is from a low of about 10 in. to a whopping 24-1/2 in. on the DeWalt, with most saws being able to rip about 12 in. wide. 

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-05-turn-knob-adjust-fence.jpg" alt="" width="624" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2327" />

<strong>Turn the knob on this DeWalt to make precise fence adjustments. The unique rack-and-pinion system keeps the fence parallel to the blade, and the extended rails make this one of the few saws capable of cutting a 4x8 sheet of plywood in half. The maximum width of rip is a little over 24 in., while most saws top out at 12 in. wide or so. This is the only bench-top saw with an exceptional fence.</strong>

<h3>Does It Accept Dado Blades?</h3>

<strong>Look for a saw that accepts dado blades.</strong>

With a set of dado blades, you'll be able to cut grooves, called dadoes, with your table saw. By stacking the right number of blades on the arbor, you can cut dadoes from 1/4 in. to 13/16 in. wide in one pass. Check the saw manual to see if the saw accepts dado blades and what other accessories, like a different throat plate, you'll need to use them.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-06-look-for-saw-accepts-dado-blades.jpg" alt="" width="623" height="240" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2328" />

<strong>Look for a saw that accepts dado blades if you intend to do cabinet work. Most will hold up to a 1/2-in. wide set of dado blades. Some, like the DeWalt shown here, accept up to 13/16-in. wide blades. DeWalt provides a second wrench to keep the arbor from spinning while the blade nut is tightened. This is a feature worth looking for.</strong>

<h3>How Heavy Is It?</h3>

<strong>Look a saw you can lift without breaking your back.</strong>

These saws range from a lightweight 36 lbs. to about 75 lbs., and it's not surprising that the more expensive the saw is, the heavier.

Once again the mid-priced saws offer a nice compromise, being heavy enough to stay put when you're pushing a board through, but compact and light enough to toss into your trunk or lift onto a shelf.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-07-lift-saw-to-move-around.jpg" alt="" width="637" height="919" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2329" />

<strong>Lift the saw to see how easy it will be to move around. Some of the saws are real brutes. You may need help moving the heavier saws.</strong>

<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>

The bottom line is this. You can buy an excellent quality bench-top table saw that will do 90 percent of what you'll want a table saw for, but don't plan on building cabinets or fine furniture with this saw.

For this type of woodworking, you'll want to consider spending a few hundred dollars more for the best benchtop saw or a good-quality, contractor's table saw.

<h2>Controlling Your Table Saw Alignment</h2>

Here's how to get top-notch work from the king of shop tools.

Whether you're a beginner on the table saw, a prospective first-time buyer or an old hand — with all 10 fingers — I will give you useful information about this do-almost-everything tool.

The first requirement for getting clean, accurate cuts with your saw is having all its working parts in tune. That means having the blade and the fence and the miter gauge properly set and in accurate alignment, as shown in Photos 1 through 5.

Saws fall out of adjustment with use and wear, so make periodic checks.

Since each brand of saw is a bit different in the way its fine-tuning adjustments are made, I can only tell you how to check your saw for accuracy. I can't tell you exactly which screw or nut to turn on your saw to properly align its parts. Your owner's manual will indicate where the adjustment points are.

<h3>Adjust Your Table Saw Blade's Parallel Alignment</h3>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-techniques-01-adjust-blade-parallel-allignment.jpg" alt="" width="615" height="648" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2330" />

<strong>Adjust your blade's parallel alignment, if necessary, so that the blade is exactly parallel with the miter gauge slot of the table.</strong>

Determine the alignment accuracy from the slot to the blade with an adjustable square at both the front and the back of the blade.

For accuracy, rotate the blade so that your measurement will be against the same tooth at both front and back.

Consult the owner's manual for how to set the blade's alignment adjustment on your saw.

<h3>Adjust Your Table Saw Fence</h3>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-techniques-02-adjust-fence.jpg" alt="" width="667" height="656" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2331" />

<strong>Adjust your saw fence so that when clamped tight it's 1/32 in. farther away at the rear of the blade than at the front of the blade.</strong>

Only the leading edge of the blade does the cutting, and the 1/32-in. space prevents burning and blade marks on the cut edge. When cutting, make sure the board stays tight against the fence. See your owner's manual for how to set the fence alignment adjustment.

<h3>Check the Blade for Vertical Adjustment</h3>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-techniques-03-check-blade-for-vertical-alignment.jpg" alt="" width="619" height="508" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2332" />

<strong>Check the saw blade for exact vertical adjustment relative to the table using an adjustable square.</strong>

Remove the throat plate and place the square along the full flat surface of the blade to ensure square-edged cuts.

<h3>How to Verify Miter Gauge is Square to Blade</h3>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-techniques-04-verify-miter-gaugeis-square.jpg" alt="" width="737" height="499" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2333" />

<strong>Verify that your miter gauge is cutting exactly square:</strong>

<ol><li>Cut a board that has two straight edges with the miter gauge set at 90 degrees.</li>
<li>Flip one of the cut pieces over and lay the two long edges against a straightedge.</li>
<li>If the miter gauge is accurate, there will be no gap at the butted ends of the two pieces.</li></ol>

Adjust the setting on your miter gauge if necessary.

<h3>Get Accurate 45-degrees Cuts With Your Miter Gauge</h3>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-techniques-05-cut-accurate-45-degree-angles-with-miter-gauge.jpg" alt="" width="766" height="496" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2334" />

<strong>Cut accurate 45-degree angles with your miter gauge:</strong>

<ol><li>Mount a fence extension to your miter gauge with two screws, then glue sandpaper to its face.</li>
<li>The longer fence extension provides greater cutting stability, and the sandpaper prevents the workpiece from slipping as you cut.</li>
<li>As shown in the inset photos, test your miter gauge for its 45-degree accuracy by cutting a 45-degree angle in a fairly wide board, then flip the board over and cut an opposite angle, forming a point.</li>
<li>The angle at the point should be exactly 90 degrees.</li></ol>

<h2>A Quality Saw Blade</h2>

The second requirement for super-satisfying cutting is a good saw blade.

Use a high-quality carbide-tipped blade with at least 40 teeth.

A blade identified as a "combination blade" will give good results for ripping, crosscutting and mitering. It will also work well with plywood.

There are two basic types of saw blades. The standard carbide blade makes a cut, or kerf, 1/8 in. wide.

Thin-kerf carbide blades make a thinner cut, and therefore put less drag on the motor, making them ideal for smaller, less powerful bench-type saws.

However, thin-kerf blades don't last quite as long as standard blades, and they're a bit more delicate; with a lot of cutting in thick wood, they can warp.

<h2>Table Saw Jigs and Accessories</h2>

The beauty of the table saw is that you can make a multitude of simple jigs or accessories for it that will allow you to make almost any cut imaginable.

Photos 8 through 11 show several of these useful accessories, but this is by no means the whole story.

You can make jigs for cutting specialized dadoes, rabbets, grooves, bevels, and dovetails.

<h3>How to Build a Table Saw Long-Bed Fence</h3>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-techniques-06-build-diy-long-bed-fence.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="609" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2335" />

<strong>A long-bed fence is easy to build and allows you to cut long pieces accurately, plus it supports the cut pieces as they pass beyond the back edge of the saw.</strong>

The dimensions given are approximate; make yours to suit your saw and your needs.

<ul><li>Screw the infeed and outfeed beds to the bottom edge of the fence section.</li>
<li>Make the open space between the two beds about a foot longer than the depth of your saw table.</li>
<li>Screw the fence section to your saw fence from the backside.</li>
<li>Round over the leading edge of the outfeed table so that your workpiece won't get hung up on it.</li>
<li>Keep a push stick where you can readily grab it for cuts close to the saw blade.</li></ul>

<h3>Table Saw Outfeed Table Plans and Instructions</h3>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-techniques-07-build-diy-outfeed-table.jpg" alt="" width="677" height="634" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2336" />

<strong>A simple outfeed table supports a larger piece as you push it beyond the saw table — a great help for both accuracy and safety.</strong>

A 4x4-ft. table is ideal, but a permanent table this size probably takes more space than you can afford. To save space, mount your outfeed table on sawhorses, and keep it stored on edge behind the saw when not in use.

Adjust the height of the sawhorses with blocking, or by cutting the legs, so it's exactly the same height as the saw table.

Round over the leading edge of the outfeed table so your workpiece won't get hung up on it.

<h3>Combine the Long-Bed Fence and the Outfeed Table</h3>

Cut large pieces, including full sheets of plywood, using a combination of the long-bed fence and outfeed table.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-techniques-07-combine-bed-fence-and-outfeed-table.jpg" alt="" width="611" height="773" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2337" />

<strong>The long auxiliary fence helps you maintain a straight-line cut for its full length.</strong>

<h3>DIY Table Saw Station with Dust Collection</h3>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-techniques-08-build-saw-table-dust-collector.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="702" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2338" />

<strong>Build a table saw station with dust collection that gives stable support for your benchtop saw, and will help keep your shop clean.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-techniques-08-saw-table-dust-collector.jpg" alt="" width="413" height="381" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2339" />

The angle-sided hopper funnels the sawdust to its bottom where the shop vacuum can suck it all away. The hopper slides out so that you can remove any occasional sawdust jam-up.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-techniques-08-saw-table-dust-collector-plans-dimensions.jpg" alt="" width="699" height="550" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2340" />

Make the vacuum hose connection at the bottom rear of the hopper using a short piece of 1-1/2 in. PVC plastic pipe and a 1-1/2 in. PVC coupling, threaded at one end.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-techniques-08-vacuum-hose-connection.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="315" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2341" />

The threaded coupling will screw tightly into a hole in the hopper end that you can cut with a 1-5/8 in. hole saw.

About eight turns of duct tape around the PVC pipe end provides the right diameter to accommodate the standard shop vacuum hose.

<h3>How to Cut Thin Strips on a Table Saw</h3>

Make repetitive cuts of thin strips using a 3/4-in. thick push sled with an extended end screwed to the back edge. You won't have to remeasure and reset the fence for each cut.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-techniques-09-repetitive-thin-cuts.jpg" alt="" width="745" height="660" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2343" />

<strong>Set the saw fence to the width of the sled plus the width of the strips you want to cut. After each pass, slide the workpiece against the sled, and cut again to the same width.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-techniques-09-push-sled-detail.jpg" alt="" width="632" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2342" />

<h3>Safely Cutting Shallow Edge Bevels on a Table Saw</h3>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-techniques-10-shallow-edge-bevels.jpg" alt="" width="633" height="677" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2344" />

<strong>Shallow edge bevels, such as you might want for cabinet door or drawer edges, are tricky and require precision.</strong>

<ul><li>Screw an auxiliary fence about 8 in. high to your saw fence to guide the workpiece exactly vertical.</li>
<li>Hold the workpiece firmly against the fence by clamping a feather-board securely to the saw table, using blocking to raise it higher than the saw blade.</li>
<li>The feather-board, useful as a third hand for many cuts, is easy to make from any 8-in. wide board or piece of plywood.</li>
<li>Cut the end to a 30-degree angle, then mark parallel to this angle 10 in. back.</li>
<li>Make multiple cuts back to your marked line, making each finger 3/16 in. wide.</li>
<li>Clamp the featherboard to the saw table so that the fingers will bow slightly as the workpiece passes alongside.</li>
<li>When cutting the edge bevels, press down firmly on the workpiece to prevent the blade from raising it.</li>
<li>Use a thin push stick to push past the blade.</li></ul>

Make sure your outfeed table is exactly flush with the saw table to ensure smooth movement of the workpiece.

<h3>Using a Hold Down Block for Dado Cuts</h3>

<strong>Accurate cuts with a dado blade require a firm hold-down and side support since the wide blade exerts strong upward force against the work-piece.</strong>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-techniques-11-dado-blade.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="595" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2345" />

To hold the workpiece flat against the table, make a hold-down block from two pieces of wood screwed together at right angles, and clamped to the fence.

Use a featherboard to hold the workpiece tight against the fence.

Push the board past the blade with a push strip that's thinner than the work-piece so that it will pass under the hold-down block.

<h3>Safe Cutting</h3>

Cutting safely with a table saw is a state of mind. Most accidents happen inside your head before they ever happen to your body.

Cultivate a healthy fear of the blade; the day you lose your last bit of fear is the day you could get into trouble.

Some other short tips:

<ul><li><strong>Think through</strong> every hand and arm movement before you make it. This will slow you down, but slow is safer than fast.</li>
<li><strong>What's your mood?</strong> If you're grumpy, tired or angry, go watch the ball game instead of cutting wood.</li>
<li><strong>Form a mental image</strong> of where the entire blade is, even if most of it is hidden in the workpiece, and keep this image fixed in your head as you cut.</li>
<li><strong>Use the blade guard</strong> whenever possible, even if it's a big bother. When using the blade guard is impossible (as in Photo 10), use extreme caution.</li>
<li><strong>Always keep</strong> the piece you're cutting absolutely tight against the fence or miter gauge to pre-vent the blade from grabbing it and throwing it back at you. Never try to cut any-thing without using the fence or miter gauge to guide it.</li>
<li><strong>Wear hearing protection and full-surround eye protection</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Keep your blade sharp</strong>. A dull blade requires excessive pushing effort, which is dangerous.</li>
<li><strong>Use a push stick</strong> or push strip (Photos 6, 10 and 11) to move your workpiece to avoid getting your fingers near the blade.</li>
<li><strong>Unplug the saw</strong> before touching the blade with your hands or making saw alignment adjustments.</li></ul>

<h2>Table Saw Improvements</h2>

<h3>Pegged Table Saw Tools</h3>

Are your table saw accessories where you need them — when you need them?

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-tips-01-pegboard-panels-to-hang-accessories.jpg" alt="" width="683" height="773" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2346" />

Attach pegboard panels to the stand to hold the wandering herd of push sticks, blades, throat plates, wrenches, and jigs. On an open metal stand with angle-iron legs, drill holes in the legs and bolt the pegboard in place.

<h3>Right-On Octagons</h3>

If you've ever cut an octagonal piece for a project, you probably "snuck up on it." You drew the shape, shaved off the corners with a jig-saw, and sanded to the line.

Next time, clamp this plywood holder to your table saw's miter gauge and you'll be able to cut perfect octagons of various sizes in seconds.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-tips-02-cutting-octagons.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="576" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2347" />

<ul><li>Cut a square corner in the plywood and, adjusting the miter gauge, set it 45 degrees to the saw blade. (Screw a strip of wood to the jig so it's easy to clamp to the miter gauge.)</li>
<li>Hold the square workpiece firmly in the corner cutout and push it through the blade to snip off a corner.</li>
<li>Rotate a quarter turn and push it through again to clip off the next corner. </li></ul>

If you start with truly square workpieces, this jig will cut perfect octagons every time. Cut a few extra squares to practice on!

<h3>On-the-money 45-degree Miter Gauge</h3>

If your table saw's blade is parallel to the miter slots, try this easy way to set the miter gauge for making perfect 45-degree cuts.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-tips-03-perfect-45-degree-cuts.jpg" alt="" width="749" height="826" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2348" />

<ul><li>Unplug the saw and lower the blade below the table.</li>
<li>Lay a carpenter's square on the table with one leg butted against the miter gauge.</li>
<li>Adjust the miter gauge until one edge of the miter slot intersects the two legs of the square at precisely the same measurement — the larger the measurement in inches, the more accurate the 45-degree miter gauge angle.</li></ul>

Way cool!

<h3>Long-lasting Push Block</h3>

If you're looking for an ideal push/hold-down block for ripping boards on the table saw, just grab a scrap of 2x6.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-tips-04-long-lasting-push-block.jpg" alt="" width="666" height="438" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2349" />

Cut it 8 in. long and notch it as shown. And if you cut a 1/2-in. heel end on each "kitty corner" end, you'll double the number of cuts you can make before it's worn out.

The 2x6 block guarantees safer ripping cuts, since it keeps your hand high above the blade while exerting downward force on the board to hold the board flat on the table as you push it into the blade.

<h3>Joint-Cutting Box</h3>

Build this box from plywood or medium-density fiberboard and use it to cut tenons, lap joints, rabbets and other joints on the ends of boards. It makes accurate cuts and keeps your hands well away from the blade.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-tips-05-joint-cutting-box.jpg" alt="" width="607" height="863" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2350" />

Make the box wide enough so the clamp handle will fit inside, and screw a board on the side at 90 degrees to support the piece you're cutting.

To use the box, slide it against the table saw fence. To ensure accurate cuts, build the box with parallel sides that are 90 degrees to the saw table.

<h3>Making Raised Panels with a Table Saw</h3>

You don't need a router or shaper to make fine raised panels — you can do it with just a table saw.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-tips-06-making-raised-panels-without-router.jpg" alt="" width="815" height="325" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2351" />

The trick is to run wood sideways through the saw. For a 1/2-in. thick panel, crank a sharp 7-1 /4 or 8-in. carbide blade 1 /4 in. above the table and clamp a slotted 2x4 at a right angle over the blade.

Expose a 1/4-in. corner of the blade and push the panel against it. Make repeated passes, sliding the fence back 1 /4 in. each time, until the profile is the width you want.

<h3>No-slide Miter Fence</h3>

Here's a smart idea: press strips of stair tread safety tape on your table saw's miter gauge fence.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-tips-07-no-slide-miter-fence.jpg" alt="" width="608" height="646" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2352" />

The tape's rough surface keeps the board from sliding after you've lined it up for a cut. And both the adhesive and abrasive are tougher than self-stick sandpaper's, so these no-slide strips should last the life of the miter fence. Stair tread tape is sold in 15-ft. rolls.

<h2>Table Saw Homemade Accessories</h2>

Here are 5 simple homemade accessories for making your portable table saw safer and more versatile.

<p class="box"><strong>CAUTION</strong>: Every table saw user has horror stories about near misses and not-so-near misses. No doubt about it: Table saws can be dangerous. Always approach them with respect. Use your blade guard whenever possible and always wear safety glasses and hearing protection. Read your owner's manual and make sure your saw is properly adjusted.</p>

<h3>Extra-stable plywood base</h3>

A "must do" with any new portable table saw (when you're not using a leg set) is to attach a 3/9-in. plywood base with a hole cut in the center.

Here are the main benefits of this project:

<ul><li>This simple base allows you to clamp or screw the table saw to sawhorses, which provide a wide foundation for added stability.</li>
<li>This also raises the saw off the ground to a comfortable working height.</li>
<li>The hole in the bottom lets the sawdust fall through and helps keep the saw running cool. .</li>
<li>Drill a couple of 1/2-in. holes on one side so you can hang the saw from hooks fastened to the workshop or garage wall when you're finished using it.</li></ul>

But that's not all the base has to offer.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-accessories-01-extra-stable-plywood-base.jpg" alt="" width="618" height="369" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2353" />

<ol><li>Cut the plywood base a few inches wider and longer than the base of your saw, and then cut a 1-sq.-ft. hole in the center.</li>
<li>Center your saw on the plywood and mark the mounting holes.</li>
<li>Drill a 1/8-in. hole through the plywood at each mark.</li>
<li>Flip the piece over and drill 1-in. dia. holes about 1/4 in. deep to recess the carriage bolt heads.</li>
<li>Next, drill 5/16-in. holes in the center of the recesses. Pound in the carriage bolts, slip the saw over the bolts (use spacers if they come with the saw) and fasten the saw to the base with washers and nuts.</li></ol>

<h3>Combination Ripping and Crosscut Table</h3>

This nifty homemade plywood and 2x4 jig is designed to handle both ripping and crosscutting.

You'll have to customize it to fit your saw's table. Portable saws are light enough to suspend from the jig. Just lift and turn the saw in the jig to change it from one operation to the other.

Notice the plywood inserts (blue and green pieces) that help position the saw for each operation. See Fig. A for details.

<h4>Rip position</h4>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-accessories-02-combination-ripping-and-crosscut-table-1-rip-position.jpg" alt="" width="615" height="346" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2355" />

Rip long pieces safely and comfortably. Be sure to clamp the jig to the sawhorses and weight the rear sawhorse for added balance and stability. Follow the basic plan shown and adapt the jig to fit your saw.

<h4>Crosscut position</h4>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-accessories-02-combination-ripping-and-crosscut-table-2-crosscut-position.jpg" alt="" width="623" height="410" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2356" />

Cut wide panels such as cabinet doors or shelving with full support. For really large pieces (deeper than 3 ft.), have a helper support the pieces after you cut them or use an outfeed jig like the one shown below.

Notice that the fence clamps to the tabletop and adjusts to more than 4 ft. from the blade. Be sure to make your fence parallel to the blade and check it before each cut to ensure that your workpiece won't bind as you cut it.

<h4>Building The Jig</h4>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-accessories-02-fig-a-build-jig.jpg" alt="" width="737" height="518" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2357" />

<strong>Build the jig from pieces of 2x4, 2x6 and 3/4-in. cabinet-grade plywood for about 550 and three hours of your time:</strong>

<ul><li>Cut the opening width and depth of the plywood cutout to the same dimension as the widest part of the saw table.</li>
<li>You may need to remove 1 in. from the right end so you can move the fence fully to the right side of the table when you're using it for ripping long pieces.</li>
<li>Be sure you have adequate saw table support when you have it in the side position as shown in "Crosscut Position," below.</li>
<li>The saw table must sit on the support carriage at least 1 in. on each side.</li>
<li>We cut our carriage supports 4-1/2 in. wide from pieces of 2x6.</li></ul>

<strong>Note</strong>: Before using this cutting jig, be sure to clamp it to each sawhorse and then weight the far horse with a sandbag or a full pail for added stability as shown.

<h4>Building The Fence</h4>

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-accessories-02-fig-b-build-fence.jpg" alt="" width="711" height="317" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2358" />

<strong>Build this fence from 2x4 lumber and two 3-in. C-clamps.</strong>

Just cut the slots as shown and drill a 5/8-in. hole 3/8 in. deep to keep the clamp from drifting as you tighten it to the table.

<strong>Note</strong>: Insert the clamp before gluing and screwing the T-square end of the fence. 

<h3>Cut-off Block for Duplicate Lengths</h3>

Dangerous kickback can occur when you crosscut directly against a rip fence. Kickback happens when the pan of the board between the fence and the blade gets pinched, and the blade, spinning toward you, catches it and hurls it back at you.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-accessories-03-cut-off-block-for-duplicate-lengths.jpg" alt="" width="661" height="617" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2359" />

You can prevent this hazard with a simple block.

<ul><li>Cut and clamp a block to the side of your rip fence and then position the fence the correct distance from the blade (the length of cut plus the thickness of the safety block) .</li>
<li>Clamp the block so that as the workpiece enters the blade, it's no longer in contact with the safety block.</li></ul>

This crosscutting method prevents the workpiece from binding between the fence and the spinning blade. Never make a cut that binds against the blade in any way. Think through all your cut setups before you start! 

<h3>Dado Guide Using Standard Blade</h3>

Cut accurate dadoes without a dado blade by making successive passes over the blade. The tough part here is to get a tight fit.

Screw a 1x3 fence extension to your miter gauge and make a saw kerf in it. For a tight fit, trace the width of the board onto the homemade miter gauge fence extension (see Step 1 photo). Then follow Step 1 and 2 photos.

Try this method on a test piece to get the hang of it.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-accessories-04-dado-guide-using-standard-blade.jpg" alt="" width="806" height="519" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2360" />

<strong>STEP 1</strong>: Make your first cut by aligning the top dado mark with Line No. 1 drawn on the miter gauge fence.

This cut establishes the top of the dado. The line takes into account the thickness of your blade.

<strong>STEP 2</strong>: Make your second cut by aligning the same dado mark with Line No. 2 on the fence shown in Step 2. 

This cut establishes the bottom of the dado.

To finish the dado, just make several passes to cut away the area between your initial cuts. Make slight adjustments if the fit is too tight or too loose.

<h3>Simplified Outfeed Table</h3>

A simple outfeed jig supports those long, dangly boards.

Cut long pieces confidently with an easy-to-make outfeed jig screwed to your plywood base. Be sure to have the highest point of the jig even with the saw table.

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-accessories-05-outfeed-jig.jpg" alt="" width="645" height="671" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2362" />

The gradual incline of the jig (about 12 degrees) helps guide sagging pieces and slowly bring them up as you push your board through the saw.

Ordinary roller-style outfeed supports don't work well for long boards because they have a tendency to tip over when the board sags and hits the stand beneath the roller.

This jig works especially well for long, thin pieces such as siding, which tends to sag and separate as you cut. 

<img src="http://bestlife52.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/table-saw-accessories-05-fig-a-build-from-scraps.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="509" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2361" />

<strong>Build this simple outfeed jig from ordinary 3/4-in. plywood and 2x4 scraps.</strong>

Be sure to screw the jig to the plywood base of the saw for stability your saw base must be screwed or clamped to the sawhorses as well).

You won't need anything other than a single 2x4 for the far leg support.]]></content:encoded>
